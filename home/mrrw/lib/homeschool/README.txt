Steps I can take now (to prepare myself for homeschooling in Pennsylvania):
	1. Research and document homeschooling laws for the upcoming year
	2. Research the contents and testing standards of the PSSA (or equivilent)
	3. Create or find documentation templates (see askpauline.com)
		A. log sheets for various uses
		B. affidavits and certifications
	4. Put together a demo portfolio
	5. Put together an admin binder (for permission slips, waivers, calendars, admin logs, and other legal/administrative stuff)
	6. Build a curriculum per student for the upcoming year

Attendence and Affidavit Requirements:
	Students must complete 180 days or 900-990 hours per school year.  Useful forms for recording days include:
	The academic "accounting year" for homeschoolers is July 1st through June 30th.  
	The affidavit must be turned in no later than August 1st (unless it's your first year).
	NOTE:  Some homeschoolers file the next years affidavit along with the current years certifications.
	NOTE:  You may pull your child out of public school at any point, as long as you file the affidavit before doing so!

Required Forms:
  NOTE: A slew of forms have been made available, many of which are redundant and none of which are official.  Use what works for you. 
	1. Students must complete 180 days or 900-990 hours per school year.  Useful forms for recording days include:
		1to180.pdf
		attendancecalendar.pdf
			NOTE:  You could use either form or both, whatever works best.
	2. Statements of Instructional Times, Certifications of Completion, and like forms can be found here:
		timesubjectgraduationstatements.pdf
	3. Various logs must be submitted with the portfolio.  Use what works for you.
	4. Affidavits must be provided by August 1st, found in "forms".  Make sure to use the appropriate template!
	5. Special Education approval requires the signiture of a professional.  Found in "forms".
  NOTE:  All forms (and guidance) can be found at askpauline.com, if not your local machine.

On Portfolios:
  NOTE: You'll be building one portfolio, per child per year, as the school year progresses.
  Each portfolio should include:
	1. copy of notorized affidavit, stamped/signed/dated by school district when turned in
	2. med records, dental records, immunization records
	3. list of educational objectives by subject
	4. logs
	5. work samples

Testing:
Outline state, local, and federal testing minimum requirements.
Since I live in Erie PA, what tests are we aiming for?
	PSSA (Pennsylvania System of School Assessment)
	SAT? Couldn't find anything online about this other than universities websites.

Socialization and Outings:
	Martial arts
	other arts?
	museum trips?
	bands?
	farmers markets?
	exploration of natural environments (field trips)?

	5. Have your child evaluated by a qualified evaluator and submit the evaluators certification to the superintendent by June 30.
		a. Your childs portfolio must be submitted for an annual written evaluation by either
			i. a licensed psychologist;
			ii. a teacher certified by the state (with two years of teaching experience); or
			iii. a nonpublic school teacher or administrator (who must have at least two years teaching experience in the last 10 years in public or nonpublic schools).
		b. At the request of the homeschooling parent/supervisor, a person with other qualifications may conduct the evaluation with the prior consent of the local superintendent.  The supervisor and supervisor's spouse are not allowed to be evaluator.
		c. The evaluation must be based on an interview with the child and a review of the portfolio, and it "shall certify whether or not an appropriate education is occurring."  State law defines "appropriate education" as "instruction in the required subjects for the time required in this act and in which the student demonstrates sustained progress in the overall program."
		d. One place to find an evaluator is on the website of Christian Homeschool Association of PA (CHAP).
		e. By June 30 of each year, you must submit to the local superintendent a copy of the evaluators certification that your child is receiving an appropriate education.
		f. Additionally, if the superintendent has a reasonable belief at any time during the school year that an appropriate education may not be occurring, they may send you a letter requiring that an evaluation be conducted and that an evaluators certification be submitted within 30 days.
	6. Here's what to do if you move from one school district to another in Pennsylvania:
		Contact the superintendent of your current district of residence by registered mail (30 days prior to relocation) and request a letter of transfer.  The current superintendent must issue the letter of transfer within thirty days after receipt of the request.  After receiving the letter of transfer, file it with the superintendent of the new district of residence.
