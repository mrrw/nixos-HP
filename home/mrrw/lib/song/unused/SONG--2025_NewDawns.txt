New Dawns
	@MRM,2025

[ silence ]
	[ verse, words first, guitars on "through" ]
As we're all passing through
stop and look at the blue
there's hope for each fool
and a place for each tool
But we watch through wet eyes
evils smirk as they rise
all the hope scatters 'round
in the place they tear down
			[ pre-chorus ]
		Now it's on, and we're in for a fight
		is there dawn after darkest of night
		Just a bit and we'll see the other side
		through a tunnel of light
			[ chorus ]
	decide... ( take apart your soul )
		ends need to 
	be tied... ( find the candle in heart and light it )
		while there's 
	still light... ( and mend your soul ) 
		we still have some time.

There's a smile round the bend
As the grief slowly ends
hope we brace with some friends
when it comes round again
As we leave, will we rise
will we vibrate the skies
as we feed the underground
will our souls make a sound

		{{  PG DOWN  NOW  }}







			[ solo (pre-chorus), "soft soul making sounds" ]
			[ pre-chorus, soft ]
		All the love that failed to keep
		All the busted trust in a heap
		All the poison in thin-walled vials
		All the men flashing evil smiles
		Now it's on, and we're in for the fight
		is there dawn after darkest of night
		Just a bit and we'll see the other side
		through a tunnel of light

			[ solo (chorus) ]
				[ bridge, soft to hard ]
			New dawn in the darkest night
			Now it's on, and we're in for the fight
			Just a bit and we'll see the other side
			of the worst of the evil smiles
			All bombs coming round the bend
			with a flash coming to an end
			deepest dark and the peace begins
			just a spark and it starts again
			Set ablaze our souls again
			To the earth come screamin' in
			New dawn in the dark of night
			New strong men give us flight
			New strong men give us flight
			but new strong rise up to fight
			New dawn in the dark of night
			as the meek ones leave the earth
			
	decide... what ends need to
	be tied... while there's 
	still light...  we still have time.

		Just a bit and we'll see the other side
		deepest dark after tunnels of light
		deepest night leads up to a bang
		Just a spark starts it all again
