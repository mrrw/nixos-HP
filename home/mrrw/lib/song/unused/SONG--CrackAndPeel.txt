With great pain,
	We step into the light again
	from the darkness where we defended all our very lives and livelyhoods
With great shame,
	I see what you have in mind,
	and in ordinary times, maybe I'd just lay down and take it
	
	should we bite the 
		hand that feeds us scraps from time to time
			like dogs in dark dark pen
	Should we die for
		their beliefs and all the land they seized	
			Should we just bend and bend?

beat against the barrier between you and me
Trusted oath that failed to keep
Under the banner of fading stars
you smirk at our painted scars
In your tomb, we cannot breathe
as all your white-wash cracks and peels
We beat into plowshares all our swords
When I look up,
	you're sharpening yours.

With great ease, we
	retreat in tainted memories
	Cause we're too afraid to see
		Things dying right in front of us 
we play games, and
	and wish to God TV
	could us back alive 
		with strikes and artificial life all breaking through 

	If we could come up to our lines
		and criss-cross applesauce
			Announcements are about to be made
	The ruler that he spanked her with
		and told the judge that night
			Is on full display
	
	The fathers of old we wish had fortold our every step
	And 

	The fathers that we wish we still had have something left to say
			Still we must go our own way

they play their games, and
	would kill for their beliefs,
	and the land that they seized,
		so pray to God they don't get hold of you
		And they wanna get ahold of you

Underwater we cannot breathe
Under the new sun, crack and peel
	But look out for our own,
		and we've got something to say for ourselves,
	Is there nothing we can do?
	(lot's of us got nothing to do with each other.)
	(lot's of us got nothing to do)

Show up to fight,
	show up tonight,
Show up to fight
	show up cause it's right!

Summer breezes
	and how the lake would freeze, it's 
	amazing what we miss when
		@
Half the trees, dead
	and half of all the beef
	desalinate the dredges	
		from deep in the old riverbed

Keep the violence off the street tonight

	
	would kill for their beliefs,
	and the land that they seized,
		so pray to God they don't get hold of you
		And they wanna get ahold of youthey
	retreat in tainted memories
	Cause they're too afraid to see
		real love is standing right in front of them
