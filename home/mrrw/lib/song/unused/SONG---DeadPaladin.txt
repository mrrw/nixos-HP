I keep scraping that bowl out,
	but I still don't feel right
	waiting for my savior
	to pick me up.
The home I'd return to
	would never let me in
	for the muck of the pig-sty.

I've been the defender
	within the palace walls
	but I left that forever
	dead paladin
I keep scraping the pot shard
	I flinch when the boils burst 
but keep the pain from your eyes.


	

	But I gotta do it myself,
	there's nobody else.
	But I must confess
	I love to sit here in the dark
	When will I figure it out
	get past myself
		There's fighting outside
	and I'm sitting scared in the dark.
