Verse one, version A
Empty eyes in the mirror, empty cans on the floor.
finger prints on every corner, dust is from the year before.
Spiders find me in the winter, flies burst forth in summers heat
There are spiders in the winter, and there are flies when summer comes.
There's a devil on my shoulder, but the angle got lost in the slums.
Devil dazzles in the darkness, and it speaks to no one else but me.

Verse one, version B
Empty eyes in the mirror, empty cans on the floor.
finger prints on every corner, dust is from the year before.
Spiders find me in the winter, flies burst forth in summers heat
There's a devil in the smoke now, but it speaks to no one else but me.

There's another bright distraction, 
Stains remain in the carpets,

Clothes on the floor...  Too many chores...


And it repeats upon itself, so many living on the shelf
so many hungry hearts fall into screens.
And it repeats upon itself, another week with no one else
another seven days of mindless routine.

another bitter hand clutching a screen
And it repeats upon itself, another sheep whose shepherd left
And it speaks to no one else, and it speaks to no one else,
and it speaks to no one else but me.
There's a devil in the darkness, and it speaks to no one else but me.
