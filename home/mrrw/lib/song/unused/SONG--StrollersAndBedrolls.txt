{A, G#, F#}
	I asked him nicely to get ready,
		I changed his outfit myself
	I told 'im honest and gently
		about the coming hell
	And he almost seemed to want to, but
		I saw that look in his eye
	With "I don't know" his only answer,
		I knew better than to pry.

			But by far hardest part is
				yet to come

	I put his homework in his backpack,
		I put his shoes nice on the stairs,
	but he just sat there at the table
		with that wide, wide open stare.
	So we're not going to McDonalds,
		and we're not playin' any games,
	and we're not sitting in a classroom
		and we're not passing any blame.
		
			But by far hardest part is
				yet to come

	I helped raise so many babies
		while dealing food to the weak
	while crushing bullet hell scrollers
		while pushing strollers every week
	I laid my soul before the people
		I laid my heart before my friends
	I laid myself down most evenings,
		I laid my passion to rest

			But by far hardest part is
				yet to come
	

	I've rolled my shirts all into bundles	
		I've tied up tight my bedroll
	I push it down into my stroller
		along the dusty road
	If only I could remember,
		if only I could forget
	I tip my hat to a cloudless sky,
		to keep from burning my eyes.
			and the hardest part is yet to come.
		
		

			And by far hardest part is
				yet to come



		by far harder than is
	was the baby girls and boys,
		And pruning the old oak tree.
