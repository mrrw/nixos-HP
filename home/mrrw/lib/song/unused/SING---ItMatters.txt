Just when they knew everything was wrong,
Along came a spider and their life changed.
According to what some of us read,
The first shall be last.

Doesn't take a fall to know what hell's like
We're already half-way there
Would they ever ever know what bit them,
Would they care at all?

	Even in the bitten state,
		After the long way down,
	crosses nailed into walls,
		masks on the floor, every cor-
			rosion hits different when it's in you.

	'cause fear gives in to anger, and
		Disappointment turns into
			apathy,
		It matters to you, and 
	So it has to matter to me.

There came a summer when the smoke was rolling in
and everything was turning rather hazy
bottled water and a tenth of weed under the trees,
while they're killing everything

And they found the strength of heart, to 
take right from the start,
Leaving some of us dead,
The rest in cages.

	Even in this sorry state
		When the walls come down,
	crosses strewn out in pits,
		blue blood on the doors.
	Will he come again,
			just in time, and
		when all knews bow,
	will he just let us live?
	
		Dust to dust, that's enough
		Ass to ass, but don't touch
	Underneath the burning trees
		Light to dark, heart attack,
		When you see the form we have taken,
			You'll burn us with the leaves,
	If Jesus doesn't come back soon
		


Just when they knew something had to be wrong,
a song came drifting and they sang along
realized the cross was hanging upside-down
on the white-washed walls

Doesn't take a fall to know what hell's like
We're already half-way there
Will they ever learn how they were bitten,
do they even care?

	Venom coursing through their veins,
		deaf and blind with arms crossed.
	Pick your poison, pick you hate
		crosses nailed into walls,

	'cause fear gives in to anger, and
		Disappointment turns into
			apathy,
		It matters to you, and 
	So it has to matter to me.
