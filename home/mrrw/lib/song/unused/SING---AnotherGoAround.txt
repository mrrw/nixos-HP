	"AnotherGoAround"
	by Michael Milk

Of all the things, always thought we'd be singing together
And of all I lost, it was most exhausting to toss you out
Oh, but what I found, I found another
	reason to live

I haul a cross for a mile, never say thank you
I always hoped to make you proud
after all the doubts crossed out in my letter
	I better leave before they read it aloud to each other

Gotta find what comes around, on another go around
