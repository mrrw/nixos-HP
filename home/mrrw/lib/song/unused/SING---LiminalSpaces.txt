The enemy's on the doorstep
True prayer in the bunkers deep
Long tunnels and longer wait times
Now the pressure is at it's peak.
	Smell blood in mouths of victors
	Truth walled in servers strong
	Paid lovers of the products
	This earth don't have too long
Set fire to the old world order
Fend off this bitter night
Find love for long dead brothers
who fought for the other side
	Smell blood in the mouths of victors
	Truth walled in servers strong
	Gone lovers of the products
	This earth don't have too long
Green grass is of the past now
Old enemies give us flight
Doors rusted, bust them open
Dark buildings come to light
	Smell blood in the mouths of victors
	Truth walled in servers strong
	Gone lovers of the products
	This earth don't have too long
New earth, it smells like smoke now
Century of retrograde
Somewhere they're tracking venus
can't see it in the haze
	Smell blood in the mouths of victors
	Truth walled in servers strong
	Gone lovers of the products
	This earth don't have too long
