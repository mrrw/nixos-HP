Its the end of the week and I got nothing to live for
Except to feed the other living beings
Even if I don't, they'll get a meal from somewhere.
But still tryin to give em happy memories.

Some have a beautiful start
some have a rocky touchdown.
give it all you got,
Keep swimming until you, drown.
Sometimes you win, estatic
Sometimes you lose dramatically
	It's all the same to all the rest of humanity.

Which way should I fall when I fall, when I falter?
How many people looking at my screen?
How will I keep on going when there's nobody out there?
How many bodies make humanity?

I die alone, cause you die alone,
Most on the phone for life, meanwhile
You die alone, cause we die alone,
But bright white tunnels lead to clear light.

It's the end of an age an I got nothing to fight for
No cross to bear except my family.
And if I keep on going along without it
I'll rust into a perfect memory

I die alone, cause you die alone,
Most on the phone for life, meanwhile
You die alone, cause we die alone,
But bright white tunnels lead to clear light. (X3)
bright tunnels, bright tunnels (X8)
Bright blue and white tunnels lead to clear light.
