we lock eyes
seperated by two panes and some argon
Tell you something, I'm not blinking unless I have to.
What surprise,
You want in again
You suits are all alike, taking up the place like it belongs to you.

Don't look at me like that, I
can't stand to hear you beg,
When you defend your territory so vigorously

I shake my head, won't let you in again.
You bow your head, please let me in again.
I roll my eyes, won't let you in again.
You paw the window, please let me in again.

What surprise,
You're giving me those kitty eyes again,
	and that's when kids rush in
		to open the door.

Don't look at me like that, I
can't stand to hear you cry,
Your warmth and food have always come from somewhere.
