Midnight Oil
Phillips, Craig & Dean

Mamma always got up early
And she never went to bed 'til late
Yet, I never heard her complaining
About her family of eight
There were times she should have been sleeping
But, late in the midnight hour
She'd get down on her knees
And you could hear her say
"Lord, fill them will Your power"

Mamma like to burn the midnight oil
Down on her knees in prayer
If you asked her why she did it
She said she did it 'cause she cared
Mamma knew that Jesus was waiting
When she knelt by her rocking chair
Oh, I'm glad my Mamma was willing
To burn the midnight oil in prayer

Now Mamma's gone to be with Jesus
I've got a family of my own
Yet whenever the clock strikes midnight
You will find me all alone
That's when I start to call upon Jesus
For His wisdom and His power
'Cause it seems that He loves
To hear a Daddy's prayer
Even in the midnight hour
You might also like
Mamma like to burn the midnight oil
Down on her knees in prayer
If you asked her why she did it
She said she did it 'cause she cared
Mamma knew that Jesus was waiting
When she knelt by her rocking chair
Oh, I'm glad my Mamma was willing
To burn the midnight oil in prayer

Years from now
When my grown little boy
Has a family of his own
Will he kneel down and pray
When the hour gets late
And pass the legacy on

Mamma like to burn the midnight oil
Down on her knees in prayer
If you asked her why she did it
She said she did it 'cause she cared
Mamma knew that Jesus was waiting
When she knelt by her rocking chair
Oh, I'm glad my Mamma was willing
To burn the midnight oil in prayer

Now there's a Daddy who's willing
To burn the midnight oil in prayer
