I would like to redesign, every part the house
Where I currently reside
And I would really like to find, a way into the hearts
that the world left behind
Nobody likes losing it all, but you gotta lose sometimes
but the legs upon the ladder you claw will kick back when you fall and you try to
	rise up on the backs of the lost you ignored
	Below you, a foot that you'd never wash
	Control yourself at the interview,
	or show all the hate that makes you
	rise up on the backs of the lost you ignored
