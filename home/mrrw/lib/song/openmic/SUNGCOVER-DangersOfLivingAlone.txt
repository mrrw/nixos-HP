Can't sit still on the merry-go-round
She's a pretty-faced girl, but she's living downtown
Can't hold back on a powerful night,
she's a middle-aged girl and she isn't alright

In a room filled with memories and nothing more
she seems such a terrible sight
with a heart that is broken like a marble stone,
That's just one of the dangers of livin alone
	livin alone...

[3 sylable name] was a troubled young man
had a bundle of mags that he hid in the can
Went to work for a couple of years
now he's in it for life and a couple of beers

And he thinks to himself when you has the time
who'da thought I'da ended up here
With a belt and a bible and a love unknown
that's just one of the dangers of livin alone,
	livin alone.
