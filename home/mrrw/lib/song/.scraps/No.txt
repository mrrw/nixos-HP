	"No"
	by Michael Milk

When I said no to everybody else,
I was really saying no to myself.
	and years were lost.

I'm sure They missed me for maybe awhile,
5 stages of grief then moved on.
	life moves on.

I broke the chains of social expectations,
by loosing every bond of love.
	I was really saying no to myself,
	and years were lost.

I always wanted not to let you down,
But I became my own cowardish crowd.
Even in the depths of my solitude,
I bow down toward the cowards way out.
If I can conquer all my shame, if I can conquer my doubt,
If I could just live again, If I could break from my crowd.

If I could relive, relinquish my doubt, once-for-all
But that's a what-if, and wish-ful thinking brings rot.
Still if I did, then again, maybe they're better off.
Think of yourself, then think about everybody else.

Think of yourself, think about everybody else,
Die on the cross, life lived for love ends for the lost.
Die upside-down, and find yourself fitted for a crown.
Dead in the ground, legacy strong, but at what cost?

Think of yourself, Then think about everybody else.
Die to yourself, Think about everybody else.
Take what you give, Think about somebody else.
Love when you live, Think about anybody else.
