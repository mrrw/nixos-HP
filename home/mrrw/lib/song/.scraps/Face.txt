When your face
disappears
All my fears rise to the top.
Diamond eyes,
tear-drop smile
coffin stare through my blind spots.

I don't wanna need it,
I don't have to feed it,
Giant dopamine
I don't have to chase it,
I will not embrace it,
sucks the life out of me.

When you come,
when you leave
It's not up to you.
Girls and boys
need their toys
in the heaviest of petting zoos.


Dead iconography.
Giant dopamine
When your face
comes around
another wrinkle the screen tried to hide
