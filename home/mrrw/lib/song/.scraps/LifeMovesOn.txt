	"Life Moves On"
	by Michael Milk


If we break all the buildings older than us
and if we make a new life in this place
or if we stay and try to keep from changing,
if we pray for the old old glory

...and if the ballot was cast in the fire
and the devil comes out at last
and we dance in the light of new glory

...and if we win, we'll make a joyful sound
...and if we lose, we'll tear the place to the ground
and if we shake, is it just the spirit?


And what if everything hangs on a thread,

...and if we stand on brink of understanding
or if we play in a way that changes everything

oh,
The wishes we make, as we wait in our death bed
If we could only wake up again!

When the fire of the sun
greets our daughters and sons

...and when we won,
all of the tears that we wept as one
...and when we lost,


... when we win,
and we bury the ones who have sinned
all of our joy
bouncing off mountains for days on end

... when we lose,
when the last of us broken and bruised
are pushed into the sea,
and glaciers all dance cheek to cheek

Oh, the stands that we take
When we're so far away from
death's bed
All the promises break
As we lay down our heads
into dark and silence
	(from where we all came)

...and when we are gone
and all the children forget our name
time marches on,
despite what the dreamers say
...our grandest ideas,
fade into history like charioteers
the hopes that we croon
falling away day by day like the moon

It's coming soon
but not to you

Someday this place will grow cold,
before Sol swallows it whole



...and if the war is for good
and the stumbling kk
