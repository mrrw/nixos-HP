C, G, B, C.  C, E, D, C.
	(when there's a problem...)
C, G, A, E.  C, E, C, E.
Always something we gotta fix, the boiler or the roof
so pitch up shelter cause the rain will run
	(Yeah, there's a problem)
C, G, A, E.  C, E, C, E.
all the buildings still fallin apart cause God is so aloof
We pray for rapture, for the end to come,
	(when there's a problem...)

		G, A, C.
		Well, there's a problem.

C, G, B, C.  C, E, D, C.
	(when there's a problem...)
C, G, A, E.  C, E, C, E.
got a stash of magazines, some beer and ciggarettes
got excuses and distractions and some time to kill
	(Yeah, there's a problem)
C, G, A, E.  C, E, C, E.
In God We Trust to help us out when we can help ourselves
But you and I could lend a hand to help the rest
	(when there's a problem...)

		G, A, C, G, A, C, E, A, C.
	Hey!	 I found a problem,
		Yeah, there's a problem.
			You see that problem?
	Hey!	Lets fix a problem!

3x {C, C, C, C.  E, E, E, E.}
All these problems in my minds eye
Bleeds all my time till I'm gone
Can't seem to take my eyes off

If you could reach out with a pillow.
If you see... my heart on it's way down
	Just be around, help me be around.
Hope I seem to feel... 

looky me, my heart's set free, 'n we're long gone!


I see you walked from grace, I hear the words you say.

If and when you find how hard my hearts become
If you come to walk my way
Hope you find you lose the path after you arrive,
and you don't regret it for too long. 
The grace of everyday can only wash away
And if you find me face-down in the lake,
Say it's an accident, just another mistake.

And if you find the grace, our memories will
Only hold the best of me

And if I stowed away, your memories'll hold
the best of me
