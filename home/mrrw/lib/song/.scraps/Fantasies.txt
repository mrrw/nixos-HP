I see so many the fantasies, all around me.  
And I wanna think that they are real, that they are real
Cause something tugs at me, and I am changing, even as I wonder why,
as I watch all opportunities die

This wait is killing me.
This wait is killing me.


I see so many the fantasies, all around me.  
And I wanna think that they are real, that they are real
