	"FindOut"
	by Michael Milk

If I find the way, I'll make a hell of a living
If the cards a spade, it would help with the digging
Gotta find the play that brings the brave to the ending
Gotta I find a way

When I stick my head outside,
the glint of glass in my eye
When I bring the light of day,
ego enflames the mind
When I breath for heaven's sake,
peace settles like a blanket;

Though I hold my head up high:wq
:wq
:wq
