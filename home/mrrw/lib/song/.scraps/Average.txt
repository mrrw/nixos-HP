	"Average"
	by Michael Milk

It's the end of the week and I got nothin to live for
Except to feed my nearest family.
Even if I go, they'll get a meal from somewhere,
and struggle with a swath of memories.

But it's alright, cause we're alright,
It's not the worst it's ever been.
We had a fight, there was some doubt,
Average out is average in

Every morning was struggle to get ready,
And every evening was anxiety
It all mattered cause someone was watching,
The big eye in the sky so sad at me.

But it's alright, cause we're alright,
It's not the worst it's ever been.
We had a fight, we worked it out.
There's nothing to it once again.

We found a way...
