	"Holes in the Pocket"
	by Michael Milk

iHe doesn't know where in pants he be livin
he trust himself, the only way he be livin
He understands just enough to give in to it

No time to wait even the briefest of moments.
The hammer plug is underneath her bedorfus
a gunner under every pile of surmorphis
No way to break over the rocks that contort us
we lose momentum right before losing gophers
This underwater spell, brings undesired hell
We understand it well, winter forever melts
