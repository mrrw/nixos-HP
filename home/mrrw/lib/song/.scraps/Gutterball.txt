	"Gutterball"
	by Michael Milk

She bends down to pick the bud up off the ground
	sucks it down
after brushing off the broken glass
	from the luckk she found
Her life is crashing on the rocks

Hand me downs from her family long gone 
	gets free clothes from the morgue
and she gets off on rocks and tar when she can
	and the call her a whore
One step at a time till she falls off.

She found a bed down in a lonely gutter,

now she's just another silent mother
leaving kids behind

She found a bed down in a lonely gutter,
