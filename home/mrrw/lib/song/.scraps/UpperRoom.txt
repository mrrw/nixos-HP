Comin round again...
How long was I gone this time?
Can we take this slow?
How long was I gone this time?
	I just had to be wrong...

The floor was cracking
	(how long did I believe?)
the paint was pealing
	(how long did I decieve myself?)
as plaster chunks fall from the ceiling
	(how long did I believe?)

Jack's house was leaning out
I had to burn it down
Then came the global drought
Nothin but sheet slab on dry ground

(how long did I believe?)
(how long did I decieve?)

[interlude, quiet]
[interlude, loud]

how long did I believe?
	(Jack's house was leaning out
how long did I decieve?
	(I had to burn it down
how long did I believe?
	(Then came the global drought
how long did I decieve myself?
	(Nothin but sheet slab on dry ground
