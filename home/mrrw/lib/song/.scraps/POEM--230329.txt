Pale and weak from long isolation, and from
fear of losing her way forever,
She finally broke from the copse of make-believe trees.
She had slowly wandered from the village in their worship,
they who gave thanks for the canopy.
Not far off was the end of the land itself.
Prone and wracked with excitement and terror
as she inched her nose over the edge,
it was impossible not to tremble looking to the ground thousands of
miles down, barely visable beneath an ocean of atmosphere.
The remnant of her faith in the canopy collapsed under
stark reality. 
For a time, she wanly watched the mechanized life
jittering about fervently in the sallow glow of plastic leaves.
Sourly drinking in the false forest,
arms crossed her chest against the sweeping wind,
she pitched herself into the firmament.

When she awoke, she found her eight legs were broken.
She managed to crawl along the spaces between the floors and walls,
and after an eternal struggle, found herself in the bright safety of a terrarium.
There she healed, but could not scramble up the smooth glass walls.
She languished, the new life in her turning grey and cold
until her carapace plunged into the icy depths of reality.

Jolting awake, she found her heart was broken.
Trembling in the thrall of new and old terrors,
her slackjawed begging was met only with
hurried politeness from those passing by
in a grand pan-human parade of diaspora
conducted by all the pressures on earth.
