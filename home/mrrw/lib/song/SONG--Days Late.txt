If we heard the soft and steady whisper of her dying breaths,
	did we chose death
by steady burn, a burden that we kicked so far down the road,
	such a heavy load
and such a trial, the lies a bonfire on our last cool night
	so much wasted time
	so much wasted life

we found our fall, the pits of tar that brought us all so far
	into the smog
So burn it all to burn the pockets holding us all up.
	so far to fall
	but burn it all

smell the earth?	 The sun is doing its best work
see the haze,			 it runs together all the days

If we saw the wall and didn't try to knock it down,
	we could be so strong
and if we bought the pills that kept us quiet in the dark,
	spoon-fed so long
If we heard the soft and steady whisper of her dying breaths,
	we may not say
and if we burn as would-be saviors too afraid of intervention
	we burn in vain,
	can't we ever change?

smell that earth?	 The sun is doing its best work
see the haze,			 it runs together all the days
feel the pound 			 of heavy heads against the ground
it hurtles by,			 the chance to stop the burning sky
smell that earth?	 The sun is doing its best work
see the haze,			 it runs together all the days
