Am7                                     F/Bb9, F, F/Bb9, F 
    A warm breeze through the window
Am7                                     F/Bb9, F, F/Bb9, F 
    Sunlight playing on my knees
Gm9              A/F                    F/Ab, F/Eb, F/Bb9, F
    all the time changes were coming

    I miss the green lights running Peach

#     Things move on, while we make song
#     Things move on, while we make
# Ab7                     Gb7
# plans underground, in the deafening sound
# 
# F/Bb9           F 
#     Things move on, while we make friends
#     Things move on, while we make 
# F/Ab        F/Eb        F/Bb9           F
# life on the earth as it comes crashing down.  Yeah,

# Everything ends, 'til it comes back around

Am7                                     F/Bb9, F, F/Bb9, F 
    Dreamed everything was getting better
Am7                                     F/Bb9, F, F/Bb9, F 
    Screaming as I wake up late yet again
Gm9              A/F                    F/Ab, F/Eb, F/Bb9, F
    all the time boys on top were in position
Ab7            Gb7                      F/Ab, F/Eb, F/Bb9, F
    The rest of us live off of media, fixed in time.
