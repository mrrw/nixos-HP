We were not made for current earth
We tried so hard for what it's worth,
	Is that really nothing?

Our world will break before we bend,
self-centered stow-aways from birth
	making a mess of heaven.
	
	So how we gonna bring
	when we can't even live together?
	Yeah, I think it's time we sing,
	Cause we aren't gonna have forever!


Why would you wanna save the earth
with the next world calling out your name,
	You can barely wait to leave.

	(with the world burning)
Singing the praise of Jesus' worth
So loud it drowns out everything
	Like you've died for heaven
	Yeah, you already died for heaven

	So how we gonna bring
	when we can't even live together?
	Yeah, I think it's time we sing,
	Cause we aren't gonna have forever!
	
		If the future brings, belief collapsing suddenly
		The beauteous wings, the feather wax melting off
		And all the lingering potential futures tearing us apart
		the death they bring is 

DJT is a fabulist.  JD Vance 		Near future brings...  ...all bubbles popping suddenly
		And all those things... ...  that worked to keep us apart
		Fly with white wings... ...  pure as the very face of God,
		The death they bring... ...  Is over soon as it's begun!
		what we mistake for doves, Are bats.
	[solo, verse]
I miss your face for what it's worth.
