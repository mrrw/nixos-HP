	We set out to find the ivory tower, 
and now we're stuck the mire
	but if you recall, we been through this all before, 
Yet now I'm losing my horse

	It was just a ride...  Are we just outside?
		Long gone the oroborous
	and we're up to our necks this time

	Swamp of sadness got me stuck again...  ...I miss my friends
	Cause the one I had gave in...  ...Is this the end?

	Just lift up your eyes...

	No rope or bridal works, we've tried
The nothing deep in her sad eyes,
	I scream my love but she can't try... ...she just looks on
and then she was gone.

		I'll sink myself if I don't find
		some hope and a rescue vine

	I'll sink myself if I don't find
	friends of mine

	(Swamp of sadness got me stuck again) x3
	[ break --ring out on 

	Just lift up your eyes,
	     lift up your eyes.
	(We're all around you!)

	Just lift up your eyes,
	(We're all around you!)
	     lift up your eyes.
	(We're all around you!)
