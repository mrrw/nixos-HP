[intro] 		8-C#, 2-A, 2-C#

He blocked with his sentence, walls I'll never scale
I scan all directions, for a place to heal
	to stay concealed

We found a new order, a way we can live
that house gets knocked over, by those bent to kill
	The threat is real
[tag]				B, G#, B
		But we still live out in the open.

	We can't stop we won't stop,
	We can't stop living in the open
		We won't stop
	We won't stop living out our love!

I read her expression, denials I can't appeal
and calls for rejection, with cold white burning zeal
	she swears we steal

We finally find it, we find our way out.
We used to be silent, and riddled with doubt.
They fight to restrain us from loving ourselves
If we don't keep moving, they'll keep us on the shelves 
	Yeah, they'd rather keep us in hell
	Time to live out in the open.

[bridge]		6-A, 2-C#, 2-G#
	We can't stop, we won't stop,
	Won't stop living in the open
	we've got the chance to prove
prove that we found love
	We can't stop, we won't stop,
	we'll live our love out in the open.
	We got everything to lose,
And if we die in the open
		We died to live in the open.

[crescendo]		16-C#

Can't stay concealed.
