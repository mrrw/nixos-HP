Will you fall off whatever cliff is in front of you?
She said all of a suddon then turned her back on me.
Will we crawl through the mud again?  Will I drag us there?

all color gone when she goes away;
tunnel into the gray.
the story ends, the work and the play;
tunnel into the gray.

Will you stall if you turn your nose up into the air?
I said without thinking about her steady hand.
Will she noose the tie round my neck?  Will she fly us there?

all color gone when she goes away;
tunnel into the gray.
the story ends, the work and the play;
tunnel into the gray.
all color gone when she goes away;
(x3) tunnel into the gray.
