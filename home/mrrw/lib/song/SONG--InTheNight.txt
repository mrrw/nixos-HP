[vs]
From the heighest of heights to the lowliest vallies,
the depth of our phallicies bury us all.
in the walls that stretch on in between,
and maybe someday we will see.

[vs]
This path is a labyrinth they built
to keep us all gnawing away.  Our guilt is 
a crumb compared to the massive machine
they built just for you and for me, the 99

[ch]
From the planting of fields
to the mining of lithium
The mice on the wheels
The crumbling infrastructure

[vs]
This isn't the first time, you know
It happens again and again.  The madness of
all the numbers end up just a game.
The number of people they claimed 

[vs]
from the ocean floor to the satelites
The smoke of consuption, a funeral pyre
it's ours, we'll burn in our beds
we have to wake up, or we're dead.

[vs, last]
Yeah, maybe, someday we'll see:
we're living for your and for me
But 'for too long, we'll lose every chance that we have
to make up and join in the dance

In the night.
In the night, we'll be swept away into the wind
In the night.
In the night, we will end and again we'll begin
In the night.
In the night, who will be swept away into the wind
In the night.
In the night, who will be left to build back again

In the night, may we be swept away... 
		into the wind


Smell the smoke of the alter, where slaves wait to die.
the nostrils way up in the sky sneeze it out
And the smoke rises up 

All along the walls to the tunnels they caved in,
the guns bent and broken under the weight
of the world, the dead boys and girls they buried
with bombs in the name of their God


From the highest of heights to the holes in the ground
The 

The length of the walls held the scum of the earth
They beat on the brick to the blunt sound of scoffing
and laughing and sneering and praises to God
The love we were taught dead in piles of burned rock

Abandoned in faith, and surrounded by sin
What's the use of beliefs if they break in the wind

Alone on the planet, a tribe of just one
The earth is in retrograde, bend round the sun


This path is a labyrinth they built

C26  G27
From the highest of mountains to the holes in the ocean floor
Ab  Eb
The stains of species forevermore 

From holes in the ocean, to all the way past the sky
The smoke of consumption, a funeral pyre




When the highest of mountains finally crumble down
The worms will come crawling out
