I may be the one of us
		left alive.
You may be fortuitous,
		not to have to watch me die.
Alternate reality,
		can arrive
We're some the few of us
		left alive.
	(in the smoke and the fire of this place)

We got to goof around for awhile
	such fun, such fun
Till the coal in the great big pocket burned a hole
	and the bills are getting high
	and these bills are hell to pay
Jagged breaths in summer, worried steps in winter;
	and the lake, oh the lake.
Breathe in the scent of it all, as the seasons change,
		it's a burning age

Every city got to have their games,
	though some of us could never play

I let my anxiety build a mask around this place,
	and the love that I felt had to break away.
A burden left to bear, a door slammed in my face
	all by my past self.
