On the one hand, there's a plan
	turn us into soldiers for some
		peoples and some people who have
	never lived our lives
And a tug-of-war's at hand
	PTSD takes over as if
		overseers find us by our every move
			Since we were just kids
The algorithm lives.
	
On the other hand, we sit
	our thumbs up our own asses as we 
		watch the whole world blow the chance to 
	blow hate up in smoke.
You know, we often give a shit
	We think of all the problems that we
		may have been the cause of in
	another life
we're alowed to take a break.  No-
	body knows the struggle of a
		wasted chance like we do,
			we were born to this
				but not by our skin:
The algorithm lives.

	Sacrifice myself at the door
	Head inside cause we're waging war
	In their shoes dragging on the floor
	Dead inside cause we're waging war

	Heading down to the corner store
	Head inside cause we're waging war
	THC, lottery, and more
	Dead inside cause we're -/- 

[ spacey muted trumpet and noise solo ]

	Study hard cause we're waging war
	getting tired cause we're waging war
	Losing blood cause we're waging war
	Given up cause we're waging war
	Dead inside cause we're waging war
	Dead inside cause we're waging war
	Dead inside cause we're waging war
	Dead inside cause we're waging war
	
[ out, like trumpet solo, fade to noise ]


	Watch the kids while I'm watching porn.
	Watch my weight, but who's keeping score?
	Nothing worse than the nothing door
	Once it's open, we're free no more
		
So please cut me a break,
	'Cause no one knows the struggle of a
		wasted life on leisures I could
	Never quite repay better than me.
	
We procrastinate at best,
	and if we had every dollar that was
		given too us, some of us would
	still be broke.
Yeah, theres nothing we can do
	except to be a lover and a
		fighter at the same time
			and I don't know how to rhymne.

yeah, emotions help us fight
	the battle for the people so we
		guzzle each injustice till
	our anger shows
If we could just step back
	before it all takes over and un-
		does the fragile flowers of the
	love we sowed
