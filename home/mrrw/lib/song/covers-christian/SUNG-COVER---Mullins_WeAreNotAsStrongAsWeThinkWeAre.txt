Well, it took the hand of God Almighty to part the waters in the sea
But it only took one little lie to separate you and me
	Oh, we are not as strong as we think we are

And they say that one day Joshua he made the sun stand still in the sky
But I can't even keep these thoughts of you from passing by
	Oh, we are not as strong as we think we are

CHORUS:
	We are frail, we are fearfully and wonderfully made
	Forged in the fires of human passion, choking on the fumes of selfish rage
	And with these our hells and our heavens, so few inches apart
	We must be awfully small and not as strong as we think we are

And the Master said that faith was gonna make them mountains move
But me I tremble like a hill on a fault line
		just at the thought of how I lost You
	Oh, we are not as strong as we think we are

CHORUS

BRIDGE:
		And if you make me laugh I know I could make you like me
		'Cause when I laugh I can be a lot of fun
		Well, we can't do that, and I know that it is frightening
		What I don't know is why we can't hold on
			We can't hold on

It took the hand of God Almighty to part the waters in the sea
But it only took one little lie to separate you and me
	Oh, we are not as strong as we think we are

When you love you walk on the water, just don't stumble on the waves
We all want to go there somethin' awful, but to stand there it takes some grace
	'Cause oh, we are not as strong as we think we are
	No, we are not as strong as we think we are

Walk on the water
Walk on the water
If we could just hold on
Just hold on

We Are Not As Strong As We Think We Are
