Do I smell perfume, what's that over there?
why she so scared, what's with that hair?
I think I found her, my long-lost crush,
A matching blouse, a comb and brush.

		I found another person, ...inside my head
		I think I made it worse when, ...I try pretend
Alive, but stunted at best,     Lost her mind when she saw the rest.

		I found another person,  ...she might be dead,
	and I'm too in shock to try...  ...CPR x3

Not like we wanted this!
We were all safe and sound,
till we fell down and broke our crown
down and down,
a neverending hill
If jack and jill only knew of hell

		I found another person, ...  his wings were cut
		He thought he found a savior, ...  gave himself up
Alive, but stunted at best, Crucifixion is a painful death
		
		I found another person, ...  and so much blood
	and I'm too distraught to try...  ...CPR x5

Head in the clouds down in the valley
	(of the shadow of death)
Heart in the hands of mostly strangers,
	(down & down)
Head in the clouds down in the valley
	(of the shadow of death)
		Body in the hands of... 
	(please get off my chest)
		Body in the hands of... 
	police and EMS!
