[INTRO] --(F#m, F#m,)
	At the bottom of the breifcase                  F#m
	hides a bottle with a strong taste              F#m
	It's the only thing worth knowing               A, B#m
	when there is no easy going                     F#m
[TAG] --(F#m, F#m )
	At the bottom of the barrel
	piss stains on the walls, and animal smells
	haunted eyes and stony faces
	the whole way down is rats in races
		squirmin at the bottom of a...
	broken ride
		where we all lie.

[TAG] --(F#m, F#m, Em, F#m)

	At the bottom of the long face,						
	tears are dripping at a strong pace
	Will we ever see how this came to be?

	At the bottom of the stairwell
	secrets only several know well
	The conspiricy aristocracy.

	At the bottom of all gravel,
	silt and dust of broken arrow,
	All the dead memories remain unseen
		buried at the bottom of a...
	broken ride
		Where we all die...

[Bridge] -- (F, F, F, F#m, F, F)
	...living on in dreams...  oh...  ohhhhhhhh.......
[TAG] --(F#m, F#m)  --Tempo=slower
[VS] --(all F#m)
	At the bottom of the broken ride
	The cities built on human hides
	pressed flat under mass asphault graves
	the empty earth, the whole thing paved

[VS, out] --(F#m)  --Tempo-slowest
	At the bottom of... 
	At the bottom of........
