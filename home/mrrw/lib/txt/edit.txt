This isn't working.
I can't make "talking to her" a prerequisite for smoking.
Why?  Because I'm paralysed by anxiety in the worst moment
the moment I'm trying to rescue my drowning self
the moment of my greatest anxiety
the moment of my greatest depression
the moment of my fear or despondency or inability to act
and making that the moment that I must confront my wife to ask permission to medicate myself
This brings
shame
humiliation
the need to explain myself, even if that means framing my tale to satisfy her
dishonor
anxiety
pain
disgust
resentment
dispondancy
anger
hopelessness
paralyzation

To tell her as a prerequisite to medicate means
in the moment of my pain, I must now overcome an additional hurdle of pain.
I must admit shame, and attach shame to myself, to my weak self, to my medicated self.
I must be ashamed.
The prerequisite to medicating in this way is to be full of shame.
This breeds resentment.

She will not care.
She will say the shame is warrented.
She will thrust the responsibility back into my hands.
She will scowl and demand.
She is stoic, she is proud, she is right, she is honorable.
What do I know about honor?
I cannot even honor myself.  How am I to honor someone else?

I cannot win this fight.
I never wanted this fight.

I know that following my path will end everything.
What choice do I have?

It is my spirit, but I cannot feed it without feeding it shame.
All is laced with shame.

She cannot understand.
She will never understand.
The children will never know who I actually am;
my identity will be hidden from them.
I'm not the man that I was before,
to the shame of all;
they force this shame on me.


How can I be myself?
It's not possible.
I must come out of this closet.
