Nothing to satisfy
Nothing to interfere with us
End operation is near...

How many saw you leave?
I'm afraid it's very serious.

###prech
Feliney laugh a-from me,
caniney growl from you.
You bark and you hiss
###vs|ch
But how `ard do you bite?
how `eavy is your soul
any amount of applications, resumes, or platitudes...
###ch
(you think) you televised your world,
and we didn't like it,
and now you're all mad, an' shit
and you're mad we don't give a shit
about your feelings.
