Glass jars:  they're everywhere!
They're easy to sterilize,
sealable,
plentiful,
flexible,
sensitive sure, but long-suffering if you treat them right.

Making a sling or basket to carry a glass bottle on the person
out of common items
and perhaps some locally-sourced vegitation
shouldn't be difficult, if one knows how.
Said sling or basket could be insulated using
locally available materials.

LYRICS
There's a burrow of vermin beneath my floors
carved from detritus that I find
They squeak and shiver
    hiding from the cold outside
    and the cats within
Will this winter ever end?

When the cat comes sniffing
hiding from the cold and snow
