I'm having some anxiety today, and am considering smoking
lemon zest.  Why?  Because my life needs rearranging, and
lemon zest brings energy.  whill this energy simply cause more
anxiety?  I'm not sure.  I need to experiment with this stuff
to know.  I don't want more anxiety, but I don't want to smoke
blueberry and drearm or cheetah piss and sleep.

I could smoke lemon zest and blueberry, but I'm just not sure.
I could smoke nothing and just sequester myself in the attic.
Frankly, I need to sequester myself either way, and I don't thin
think I'll be able to spend any time in the music room.
Anxiety, you know.
