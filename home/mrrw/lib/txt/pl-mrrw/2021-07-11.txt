Humbolt.
Nothing other than a mystery
Nothing happens in my mind that can't be predicted
The changes that I find in real life
can match the best imagination

All the journeys that I've taken there
Every conversation, every act of sexual intent
Although it all pertains to me alone
Nomatter how they puff up,
they cannot fill the void

it seems like I can see my breath,
even though it's 6am in July.
So far I like it, but I know things'll change
Everything always changes, which is another thing I like

this stuff is more cerebral than I thought!
breaking every roadblock between He and me
Nothing ever comes of the things that I think I see,
Always disappointment, always an end.

In this town,
the birds talk like the polls and italiams
that lived here before.

        Tryna hold on
        to something that is not
        A goal to reach for
        A love that never was
        and never will be
    better let it go
        The strength of the flesh grows
faster than you know.
        Kinda like love,
        'xcept love is not obsession
        that keeps you tied up
        it's more than just reaction
        to the stuff in your heart
Heart in the past
dark like a looking glass
Head in the sky
flying too high
    Pack one bag, then step outside
    no such thing as a perfect life
    with every moment that we cling
    plants a new seed of suffering
        When we attach to the ashes
        that we interact with
(ona daily basis)
        it's the one time
        that we sin against ourselves
(dark like the looking glass)
        if sex is just attraction
        manifest, in action
        then how soon is adultery
        committed with ourselves
Head in the
            sky
{solo}

pack up a bag, step into the woods
take a breath and look around
now just let the rest go
and never come back
The future you is real
the future you might be real
pack one bag, step outside
