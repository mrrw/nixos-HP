I'm so hungry.  How can I freewrite on an empty stomach?
Also, I didn't go to sleep till 12am; what's worse, I was
watching videos until 12am.  that's bad, lemme tell you hwhat.
I'm not into thi s right now, but I suppose ill priess on.
Getting my thoughts out is a good idea.  Benjamin is often
talking about his thoughts (though he seems to talk less amd
less).  Oh boy, Amelia is getting up...
I don't know why she's been getting up as early as she has been.
It's kindor annoying.o

Don't YOU think?
Don't *you* think?
Don't /you/ think?
don't _you_ thinik?

I think I like *bold* more than /italicized/ or _underline_.
I suppose each has it's uses. #butts #test

When I think about writing, I think about music.  I think
critically, and I get stuck.  My eyes bulge amd glaze over.
