And he thought to himself...
	Why won't they just do the thing?
		poo brain
		Finally, they were finished with chores.
		A tiny voice piped up:  "Dad can I watch such-and-such?"
		"Not yet."
	I'm losing control.
		Why couldn't they just watch Such-and-Such?
			Why was he withholding?
			There's no good reason why not.
			They've already had so much screen-time.
			But he had indicated they could get show after chores.
		He heard the show start.
		"OK, go ahead then."
	I've lost control.
		Now he just appears weak and inept.  Foolish, even.
		No wonder his kids won't listen.
	That's just Doom talking.
		He knew his fears, while based in reality, were off the mark.
		The fears often took on a life of their own.
	I'm getting distracted
	I need to whip these kids into shape.
	I need to whip myself into shape.


Observation -- 10/4 -- TEMPO: 100

Am, Am, F, D, F  (Each chord plucked once, often on the off-beat)

Mankind caught in the deluge
Of observation
Under rocks, the worms take refuge
Isolated
We do what we can to make it through
Lie, cheat and steal, what else can we do?
When no one's watching
I'm elated
	
	Throw him under the bus
	Throw him into the car
	Put a bag on his head
	Put a cage on his heart

In the basements
Where peaceful wolves gather and tremble
Seeking shelter with careful allies
They speak the languages of fallen nations
Little pigs saying let us in, I said
Little pigs saying let us in
They speak the languages of fallen nations
To secure a noose around a native

	Throw him under the bus
	Throw him into the car
	Put a bag on his head
	Put a cage on his heart

Am, Em, G, D, Em

Observation
Isolated
When no one's watching
I'm elated
In the basement
Fallen nations
Underscores the good times we had before
that we wasted

gaslighting, mass observation,
Mass graves, mass deportation
