Brewing beer is very difficult, in my oppinion.
It may be best to invest in brewing equipment
	and distilling equipment.
	BUT,
I want to brew and distill NATURALLY,
	using the yeast found on the fruit of the field.

	Things I should be able to do in the woods for free:
Making tools from wood, stone, and iron
Making some equipment from copper
smelting copper, tin, and aluminum
growing grains, beans, and vegitables
making weapons for hunting and self-defence (bows, pole-weapons)
hunting animals for meat, fat, bones, and skins
making cordage
making textiles out of nettle or flax
making textiles out of skins
making tools from bone
	sewing needles, awls, augres
making buildings from clay-soil, straw, sticks, sand, and stone
