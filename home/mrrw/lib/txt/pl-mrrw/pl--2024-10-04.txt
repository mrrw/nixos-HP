Pickpoints, but it's not worth it if he's not around.
He is worth it, but I don't know if he'll make it.
I love him.  I don't want him to go.


	Shopping:
I will facilitate the taking of the child to the store for 10 pickpoints.
I will allow them to spend $1 for 1 pickpoint.

	Screentime:
Some screen priviledges are unlocked when the Home Health Meter is at level(s).
Under some circumstances, one must spend pickpoints.
		Movienight:
			If tomorrow is not a school day, someone can declare a movie night.
			This motion must pass a vote.  Whoever does not vote by 730pm skips.
			Once it is determined that there will be a movie night,
			If they haven't already done so, the declarer should present movie options.
			The options are put to a vote.  The option with the most votes wins.
			In case of a tie, parents decide.
			Whoever vetoes the movie may put on their own movie in a seperate location.
