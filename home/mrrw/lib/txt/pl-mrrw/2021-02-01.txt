Milkytracker.  Reaper.
Songs.  Hikes.  SAMPLES & PASSAGES.
Kat Wolper.  TMF.  JJ.

All these moving pieces.
It's so hard to keep track of.

What do I do with
all these moving pieces?

I've been working with Milkytracker lately.
Tutorial only, though
Reaper is hard, but at least I know what I'm doing.
I think the hardest part of Reaper is
knowing what I want to do
then executing it.

And thinking about how I'll adapt when we're homeless...
But that's not exactly important,
is it?
Tomorrow with take care of itself.

What am I working on today?
Getting started on Kat's "Secondhand Rain."
What to do?
Make a beat first.
Milkytracker.
Make samples in Milkytracker.
Make a beat from those samples.
