I'm testing the wordwrap option in vim.  I'm typing so as to reach the end of
the line.  It wrapped, alright, but it did so in the middle of a word without
formatting for proper ease of reading.  Unacceptable!  Well, I found a
potential solution:  Typing 'gqq' takes the line upon which rests the curser,
and breaks it as many times as needed to fit the current window.  It breaks
only whitespace, so words aren't cut in half.
	I'm freewriting now, and I'll hit enter later.  This excercise is very good for you.
