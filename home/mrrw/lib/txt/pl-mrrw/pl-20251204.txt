I don't write much because I have nothing much to say.
I would have to care about history and the state of the world to write about that
and I don't have anything but unworded love for my family.
I plant in the spring and fall.
I interact with people as I go.
I require forgiveness,
I givce some grace.
But I don't have much to say.


People could be humans, or it could be pets or wild creatures.
The order of the words doesn't really matter.
And I don't talk much these days,
and I don't make fun
Things have gotten pretty serious
and it's all been said and done.

Israel gladly killed civilians,
though Israeli populace resisted with protests.
America gladly killed civilians,
though American populace resisted with protests.
Russia and Ukraine?
China and Taiwan?
Etheopia?
The Mexican drug war?
Afganistan?
Myanmar?
Yemen?
Nigeria?
Syria?
Sudan?
