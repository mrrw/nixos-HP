Hello,
I'm interested in working and learning on your farm.  Anna Lindvay recommended you.  We're both pretty stoked about community focused urban farming, and would love to lend a hand in exchange for experience and some veggies, if you're interested.
My wife works full time, so I watch our 3 kids weekdays.  They're well-behaved and respectful.  Maybe we could visit the farm some time?
