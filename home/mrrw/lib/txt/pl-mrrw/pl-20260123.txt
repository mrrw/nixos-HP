[v1]
		no 
company's coming, the kitchen is hummin', with cursing and with footsteps
	and the natives, as they say, are getting restless
		can't keep playing blind, it's almost dinnertime!
something is smellin', like rotten melon, and how long has that been there?
	mac and cheese once again, what kind of parent
		would just fall apart, but where do I even start?
		so we got: 
[c1]
multiple strainers, yeah it's a no brainer, ya soak it if it's putrid.
A bowl in the corner, the mess is a goner, and that's how we do dishes.
[v2]
	now,
the table needs gracin', but I just keep pacin', a showdown in the kitchen.
	one will stare, one will glare, increasing tension.
		fight breaks out upstairs, I can't go anywhere
meanwhile the kitchen, with egos itchin', just gets worse from there.
[ch1]
[ch2]
make a decision, to lower the tension, it doesn't have to end bad.
love can win over, if we are stronger, and don't give in to anger. (and we'll be)
[bridge]
just...  fine.  (and we're  {yeah we're}{suddenly we're})
[v3]
	shall
one clear the table, and one sweep the floor, and one do all the dishes?
	it's a chore getting everybody moving
		and if I fall apart, how can we even
start with the corner, and end in the other, the in between will get there.
[solo, vs]
[v4]
	so
if everything's messy, and life is stressy, there's reason not to sweat it.
	And if your brain, lies and says things can't get better,
		know it's all a lie, unless you fail to try (and try again)
	
[c1] [c2]
[c3]
eating together, and talking about the weather, 'n' bearin' each others burdens.
love can flourish, and all can nourish, in the same place hate occurred in.
now company's coming, the kitchen is hummin, with laughter as you're movin'.
isn't it better, to be a go-getter, and set the world to music? (and we'll be)
[bridge] x3
[out]

nasty, repulsive, squalid
the counter is crawlin', the work is callin', the deadline is approachin'.
[c2]
make a decision, to lower the tension, it takes some strength and courage.
and make yourself warmer, 'cause you are worth it, and so is all your family.
	in the wake of the words no one can take back
		can't take anymore, broken on the floor
	so
why did I bore ya, with this short story, well let me tell you truly.
	everything
