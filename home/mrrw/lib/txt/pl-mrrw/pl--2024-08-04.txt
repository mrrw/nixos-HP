Once, in the park,
in a world turned from light to dark,
I had a vision on a swing
And nothing could bring me down again.
Orange hairs flung me,
the smoke screen wrung me,
the sticky bee stung me,
I got puff puff puffy.
Now I'm huff huff huffing,
lungs are tough on drugs, see?

I'm antisocial.  I do not want to call people.  I just want to hang out.  I want to do work.
Physical work, with people.  Removing invasive weeds.  Planting gardens.
Building benches.
