Nothing must remain.
    Smoke the dross that I saved
        from all my old chains
I thought they'd burned away,
    I thought they evaporated
        in the heat of my rage.

    wave your torches around me
    this is something to celebrate

And if we talked it out
What excuses would flow
out of our mouths?

        Watch my house as it burns away;
        every inch is hell to pay,
        but in light of the life remaining,
        this is worth every ounce of pain.

    pick up one of the torches around you,
    and help me celebrate!
    For sure, this is worth
        cheering for.

    Despite white picket fences
and crosses on the wall
    We act tough as fear ramps up
the darkness closes in
    And if we escape through the gate,
We'll find that we will fall
    but loving arms will catch us and carry us away.
The plastic land around you
    seeps into your skin
Coldest blood runs blue,
    you can't escape your sin
And when your knees break under the rod
    Oh, our greatful cheer
You can't imagine how good it will feel.

I hope to live as one with you
sometime before the sun consumes earth






we'll find another place
We got Christmas's and easters

We got picket white fences
    and croses on the walls
We have every right to live
    the way we were always told
    from times of old

They won't get our guns
    though they could take our houses
    if they wanted to
