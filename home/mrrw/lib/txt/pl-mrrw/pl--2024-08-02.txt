Another day of freewriting.
I don't really want to.
The bags on my hips dig uncumfortably into my waist nomatter which way I squirm.  Like a statue trying to 
Not unlike cuddling with a stone statue.
To keep up this pace is very difficult.

I'm like a sunflower or a pumpkin patch planted in the early spring.  I cannot be seen until Summer is coming to a close,
and my fruit cannot be found until one begins worrying about the killing chill of winter.
