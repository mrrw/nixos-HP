    I found some treasure in the dark
    and buried it, a plot of land somewhere

    I want to stay inside your dark
    I want to pray to your soul inside
    I want to take everything you hide
    I think it's time you let it all go

    I learned to die with the earth my bride
    I want to pray to the soul inside
    Just let me die, just let me die

# cho (darkearth)
    If I could wish away
    all the things that you say
    I'd still be in the black
    If you could wish away
    all the things that I say
    You'd still be wrong.

    The darkness took you far from me
    It's time to let that die
    The souls that I had loved so much
    It's time to let that die
    I think I failed at everything
    It's time to let that die
    It's time to lay it down
# brdg 2, interlude
# brdg 3, drone in Fdim or whatever
    It's time to let this body lie
    This life will fly from me
    This chance will end
    What will I become?
