I forgot what happened, just a while ago,
was I crying out from nightmares?
finally got a day off
from whatever got me down... stumbled
out from fog and I am here now

    though light is breaking once again
    I feel darkness creeping in
    I know my life,
    the light will hide
    as it has before
    fear starts to rise
    no time to find a door
    to find the door

If I could shrink
to a crack o' light
I might just find a way out
all doors open slow
noise and darkness on either side

    I feel darkness creeping in

        I prolly have just enough time
        to think about my life
        for a little while

I see the mountainside in the rearview, I pushed
out then I woke up from nightmares

a mountaintop ahead of me
coming fast, the blackest pinpoint  set in stone

    is growing as it comes for me, another dark tunnel


I see you're not coming after me.
I'm glad you know me so well
Still, I'm sad you probably believe
I'm going to hell

If you asked, I'd say "doing fine;"
you might disagree.
Still, something has been on my mind,
I hope that you answer me:

Do you think I lied
about my life?
Well you might be right,
but I was mostly lying to myself.
I'm sure you cried,
when I left your sight;
and though I died to you, the truth has set me free:
and I'm not lying.

Had I known how far the fall,
I may not have jumped.
So glad I never looked down

The bubble broke over me... I could stay no longer
amongst the plastic trees;

I will not chase you down.
They say the darkest night is right before the dawn
