Starting another day!
Good morning!

Freewriting again. This time, with music!
Listening to Malena Zavala, "La Yarara".
It's hard to type write now, but I'll do it anyhow.
I'm not going to use backspace.  I'm just gonna go.
I can proofread later if I want to keep something; otherwise,
It doesn't need to be fixed.  I'm never reading it again.
And if I do, it would be nice to see what kind of mistakes
I make.

So there ya go.  I'm not going to use backspace anymore
as long as I remember; it's a hard to habit to break, and I wonder if it's even a good idea.
I'd like to get Vim on my work computer.
I'll bet it would help me be so much better at my job.
I'll bet Justin would be all too happy to let me download
it, from a trusted source of course.

So, there's two things I'll be talking to Justing about:
    1. Vim;
    2. taking off Wed pm each weekly.

Good way to get a game ready rules:
The character ony gains experience andor unlock skills if
they deal damage and are dealt damage.
There'd have to be a way to stop the player from grinding damage
happily; make the damage unpleasent.

Amelia loves dark blue, and she loves pink.
They are her favorite colors.
She doesn't really like light blue, she says.
Her navy blue pajamas with printed kitty mugs of hot
cocoa printed all over it
came from someone for christmas.

Death has no hold over me.
This is the new vimtutor.

She's still hear,
hiding just beside me
^sitting
The bass in this song hits me just below the belt

I really enjoy Marlena Zavala's album.
I want to get her music inside my music.
I want her to inject it inside.
would she really want to?
I could send her me covering her work,
the two songs I really connected with so far, perhaps.
How do I invite her to adjust my work?
Would she really want to?
I bet if I listened to her lyrics intently
and learned what she was saying
I would connect with all of it.
Ooh!  Also, I could send her drum samples for free.
Just send them to her.  I could create samples of my work
and display them, and anyone can come and take them,
but tell me please when you do.


### NOTES
#   Proofreeding this document will be a lot of work.
#   ...and that's if I really want to go through the trouble!
#   But, it would be good practice and would help me
#   develop my writing skills.
#   one rule I'd like to implement is this:
#       If the mistake would take two keystrokes to fix
#       than fix it.  if 3 or more, proofreading.
#       The cost of retyping correct letters is considered.
#   So, one backspace and one letter retyped.  that's it.
#
#   Let it be known:  I did just go through this whole thing
#   and proofread it.  It was kinda fun.  Felt good to use
#   vim.  It gave me the chance to read my work, and it
#   wasn't boring because I was also proofreading.
