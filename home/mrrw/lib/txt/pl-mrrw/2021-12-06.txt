If I am to move operations from my phone to my computer,
a number of  things have to happen.
  * Learn to use grep and other functions to search text.
    otherwise, these logs are worthless.
  * Get Voip
  * learn to use a CLI calendar?
  * Get signal?
  * customize VIM (yeah right)
  * Spend 5 minutes looking at $~ (home, ranger)
  *

Working at work.
Gotta walk, or take the bus.  But gotta be there at 730am???
Take an hour to get there.  Gotta aim for 7am, measured pace,
get up, stretch, heat, eat, medicate, comb hair, brush hair,
dress, walk an hour.  Get up, heat and get breakfast.

Wake up:  Drawers, black breeches, shirt
stretch.
Get up.
Get dressed:  socks, wrapped tacpant, boots, upper layers, hat.
Comb hair, brush hair; add hat.
Kiss the wife and children.
Pack out:  backpack w/ rations, laptop, water, blanket, etc.
Hot pad, hot breakfast.
Pake enough food to last till dinner.
Don scarf, jacket, gloves.
Kiss the wife and children.
Grab a stick or bike and go.
Bus or walk or bike or both.
Park your ride (bike inside, stick out)

Another thing that would be awesome is if I could get i3 to do
exactly what I want.  I'm talking about having a floating
window called a Scratchpad with pl on it.  Perhaps it could
have vim with two panes, one with todays log, one with
yesterdays log.  Is it possible?  I'd have to create a script
perhaps.  Who knows.  Can't do it now, anyhow.  We'll have to
learn to be satisfied with what we have, like it or not.

Glad I created pl, but need grep to make use of.

This screen isn't the best, but this is the laptop that I have.
would be good to have two, one at home and one packed up.
They could back each other up.  Having a spare would be nice,
too.

linux questions
vim wraparound?
how to call scrathpad in i3?
one browser to rule them all?
make text browser like the one browser?
zsh alias ra for ranger
fix vim error

there's no point in trying, in going on.
Life is a waste of time
My hands ache from the work I've done,
my brain is tired
my lips are tired
my but is tired

I'm just a faker, I don't know how to dao theis stuff
I'm basiccaly broken.  I'm not a good person,
and ontheing is good.
and everything is as it should be, and that isn't good or bad
just is.

I spend a lot of effort.
I try to be cool or ogood or funny or accurate
a lot.

I't s not important, it's wasted effort.
it's good to let go, to exit
I'm not trying to explain myself to anyone.'
Just venting (not sus)
I'm not reading this.
I'm not trying to make it rhyme,
I'm not trying to create a producet.  Just typing.
I't s been awhile since I've just freewrote.
Of course, I'm njust spontaneously typing.
Not gonna stuop, not gonna use backsapace much.
notn gonna care ofif this gets erased.  Just keep typing.
go back and correct alater if you want to present this to someone.
I'm not going back and rereading any of this shit, what would be the point?
the ony thing I'd need to correct is code and emails.  i don't have to care about this at all.
don't want to form bayd typing habbits, though.
leav
let the dead bury the dead
the daipers are in a good out-of-theway spot now
I don't wantn to think about anything anymore.
I don't want to
I'm tired of caring.
But letting go helps.  Letting go of everything, including everything I care about, including myself.
Including God and Heaven andHell and endless Bardo.

I don't write often.  If I did it for 20 minutes a day, 40 minutes a day, one our a day...
If I ust used vim enough, I'd get comfortable with various commands.
I just have to do it a little.
Wow, none of these words mean anything.  It's not important whether or not I make a mistake, is it?
I've spent so much time trying to make things perfect
and for who?
Why?
I'm not happy, but happiness isn't really that important.  I'm ok.
OK is good enough.

Things I need to consider doing:

fuck that

I will pay you 2 pickpoints per day that passes
to take your bucket of laundry.  I will take one pickpoint
away from that total for every piece of your clothes
I find on the floor.

If Benjamin enters a crazy mode, or if Amelia throughs a fit,
Parents can declare Emergency Mode for that child.
This means we set a timer for 30 seconds.
The child must get to their designated emergency area
within 30 seconds.
If they don't comply willingly, they lose 25% (rounded up) of
their pickpoints and will be escorted to their destination.
While in Emergency Mode,
    Pickpoint earnings and deducgtions are suspended.
    If they leave their room and must be addressed
    either verbally or nonverbally, the child receives a
    pickstone.  As long as they have a pickstone,
    they may not earn or spend pickpoints.
    When emergency mode ends, the child will have a chance
    to
Emergency Mode - press the emergency button and everyone must
vote.  whomever gets voted out must take a time-out (a parent
might escort them to spend time with them or monitor aggressive
behaviour).  If an adult gets voted out, they have to back off.

The person voted out must go to their designated area (or an
acceptable alternative).  If they go but shoot spite, they get
a pickstone.  If they must be escorted forcably, they get 3
pickstones.  They may leave the designated area only when
emergency mode ends (only a parent can end emergency mode).

Any pickpoints earned while a child has a pickstone are forfeit.
Pickstones can only be removed by performing special tasks.

pickpoints can be earned by:
  hanging coat
  hanging backpack
  socks in bucket
  shoes in shoestation


  laundry bucket collection
  homework
  artwork

Yellow Alert:
  bullying
  excessive crying
  namecalling
  territorialism
  lying, including "as a joke, har har"
  stealing
  manipulation, as appropriate
  fighting over toys
  hitting to inflict pain
  roughhousing
  Basically, if someone says "no" and there's no attemt
    to comply.

While in Yellow, no special rules apply, except:
Red Alert may be declared if the situation escalates.

Red Alert:  Children must go to their designated Emeregency
Areas, or bug out.  nah

Red Alert:  Threats are defined and neutralized (usually Ben).


I may never read this again.
I likely never will.
I'm sorry for everything that I've said that
hurt you when you heard it,
every ounce of weight I placed upon your head,
every ounce of weight I placed upon your chest,
every ounce of pain I caused on accident,
every ounce of pain I caused on purpose.


The woman's scorn was evident;
it heated her cheeks and her voice.
Her adversary was a loved one standing in front of her,
who felt belittled by that scorn.
Though now filled with regret,
the woman was still filled with pride so she
turned with a humph
and stomped to her room
where she sat gouging herself with her newfound torment
till her heart was as dark and
quiet as the grave.
Pick points












His jolly red suit was covered in soot.
His eyes were a-sparkle with good humor as he
brought one finger to his pursed lips.
"sshh, little one," Santa mused.
The little boy, dressed in pajamas,
nodded once and zipped up to his bedroom.
"oh boy, I did just see him!" he thought excitedly.
Slowly, his excitement turned to contentment
as he drifted off to a happy slumber.

The end.
