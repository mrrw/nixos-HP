Dear Benjamin,

Back when you were a baby,
You were "bad."  But not really.
You were just a baby, having baby feels.
We were trying to teach you, and make you better.
Or, maybe we were just trying to not be so grumpy!!
Sometimes you're a brat, just like everyone is sometimes.
Sometimes bugs would shoot out your nose.
Other times, your ears would get super tiny.
Regardless, you are a bitty boy.
I digress.  Back to the apology.
Why did we spank you?
Should we have spanked you?
If not, what should we have done?
Those are questions I have myself!

There's a band called "Me First and the Gimme-Gimme's"

Nope.  We shouldn't have spanked you.  Spanking only causes
fear.  Fear is not helpful.  Remember the time I spanked you?
Actually...  Tell me about a time I sapneked you
  "In the middle of the night
    on my naked butt!!"
        --Benjamin
And why did we spank you?!  Because you smeared poop on your
face, or something.  Seriously, it doesn't matter.  Why would
we spank you for that?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!??!
 Love,
  Daddy.

   p.s., I don't believe I appologize
    often enough or sincerely enough.
