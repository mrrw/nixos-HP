I've got today off; I called in sick (I've got a bad canker sore on the back of my tongue,
and talking on the phone is out of the question).

What shall I do with my newfound day off?

KIDS IN SCHOOL, AND HOW I SHUT DOWN

School is in session (Ben in 1st grade, Nathan in Kindergarten, Amelia in PreK).
It's quite stressful, and when Ben gets what we call "poo brain," my own brain stops functioning normally.
I shut down, losing all ability to think and act.
This specifically effects my ability to work:
whether I'm involved in my son's schooling or not,
if I hear his voice change into that manic tone,
I hear Linnea commanding/begging him to stop,
I hear his manic laugh in response:
I die inside.  I shut down.  My hands drop to my side,
and I become a shell of a man.  I visit a certain special Hell
where life becomes one long, hopeless torment,
and the only escape is when he de-escelates.
I've had to leave work sick on Benjamin's bad days;
his problem becomes my problem.
I've spent a great deal of my life overcoming my own
plentiful road blocks, and it's soul-crushing that I, now in my
late 30s, have a whole new set of roadblocks stretching out
before me.  And his responses to our urging to take care of
himself ("I don't feel like it;" "that's boring;" "I don't
need to") are infuriating and offensive to the core.

THE ATTIC

Kat Wolper recently shared some resources that may help me get my attic/basement organized.  Though I don't remember the names of the books/authors she shared, she did present a method that will help me.  Label 7 boxes as follows: "Donate," "Donate," "Shred," "Trash," "Recycle," "Another Room," and "Keep."  Set aside time to spend in a specific room; set a timer; spend said time moving things into the six boxes; when the timer is finished, immediately deal with the contents in all boxes ("Donate" boxes might not be immediately deal-with-able).  Once all the boxes are taken care of, I can start another session.
I'm going to start today.  I'm going to find seven small boxes.  I'm going to set a timer for 40 minutes.  I'm going to figure out how to deal with each box:
	* Donate: Place all items in bags/boxes for donation. ###
	* Shred: Set aside for future shredding. ###
	* Trash: Trash.
	* Recycle: Recycle.
	* Another Room: Go around the house and place each item.
	* Keep: Place each item in the original room.
### Donate: Find appropriate places to donate item types.
### Shred:  Find the shredder or buy a new one, or hire out.

FRIENDS ARE FRIENDS FOREVER...

I don't currently have Christian friends (except Bryan Boleratz).  Kelley Wendt (assuming she's still, or ever was, truly "Christian") has been gone for a long time; I assume this is my fault, and I don't know how (or if I really want to) reestablish this relationship.  Zac Hatch doesn't know what to do with me anymore, or is just sad or disappointed perhaps?  Hard to tell.  COVID19 makes this particular relationship rather difficult to navigate, as he, by his own admission, "doesn't do anything any differently," that is, he doesn't wear a mask or social distance or limit contact with the public (his school is open full time); this means that I cannot responsibly have any physical contact with him at this time; perhaps after winter, we can resume.  Tim Weindorf has not called me in a long time, and the last couple times I've called him, the conversation has felt... fabricated?  Things just have not felt genuine.

DAILY PLANNER

Ok, what am I to do today?
===	I want to try to get my ham radio license;
=== I want to check my email for medical cannabis info;
	I want to work with Reaper.fm;
	I want to work on the attic.

Of course, I must eat lunch and shower at some point.
