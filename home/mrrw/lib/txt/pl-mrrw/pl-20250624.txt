freewriting, chinese, even music... They all seem like a waste of time.
It's difficult to be motivated to pursue educational or artistic endeavors.  I
just want to check the news, to put my finger on the pulse of earths pregnancy,

USA under Trump, taking the lead from Benjamin Netanyahu (sp?) has bombed Iran's

and indeed it was.
