	My tomatoe died.  Not the tomatoe push.  When I was eating the tomatoe, not from the bush, I got outside but then I dropped it
on accident.
	Why do you want us to write a sentence?
	Seriously, why?
	I wanna know how to write "I love you Dad or Mom."
	You could write "dad" this way.

	Blue words are glitchy
	Red words are itchy.
	Green words are good!
	Green means good.
	Red means bad.
	Yellow means cautious
	Brown is poop.
	Blue is water.
	Amelia is my daughter.
	Nathan is my son.
	Benjamin is my son.
	Kaela is my daughter.
	Linnea is my girlfriend
	Linnea is my partner.
	Linnea is my wife.
	Michael is my name
	Michael is myself.
	I am Michael.

	I am Linnea's husband.
	I love Amealia's outfit.
	I like Pink Ganky.
	I like how Pink Ganky smells!
	Pink Ganky loves being warm under Amelia's nose.
	That makes sense.
	Eat some food.
	Drink some water.
	Find some fun.
	Anybody can have fun.
	Amelia wants to play Bingo.
	
	Mwuah.
	What?
	When?
	Why?
	
	Wish
	Wonderful
	Poopy pants.
	AMeLIa LOVE mom                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    poooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooop mom

	OK, so this isnt really about PP, it's more about my sanity, and how to deal with everybody's shit.
What I mean is, I walk into a clean kitchen to find a cup of water spilled on the floor.
Is there a way to deal with this?  Sure, I could clean it up, but I will just be cleaning up another mess soon.
Prioritizing fucking messes is bullshit.
But, as a dad, I ahve to deal with itl.  Fucking how?
	So, I ran across a couple articles, but I'm lonely, depressed, and feeling hopeless.
I'd love to talk to linnea about htis.  I'd love to get something established.
Rules could include things like:
	A home for every object.  Each object gets decided on by kids.
