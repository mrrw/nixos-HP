Thought Experiment:
0428 (am).  I'm cutting back on my cannabis use.
Some kind of emotional bubble burst, leaving me with doubt
as to how much good the stuff can do me.
Still in the midst of reconfiguring myself after this burst.
Before cannabis use and still, I've been suffering from
anxiety and depression.  The weight of these troubles is made
much lighter when smoking, but I've increased dosage and
frequency of use over the last week; I started 'microdosing'
in the morning which helps with motivation, and I was hoping
I would get caught up on my work, which I didn't (so that
source of anxiety remains).  That was a run-on sentence.
Normally at this time in the morning, I'd focus on making
music, but I just don't feel like it.  More, I'm discuraged.
I don't want to do music; I don't see myself ever wanting to
do music, though I'm not to the point that I'm seriously
considering getting rid of my Ax8 and other studio gadgets.
I'm not sure where I'd begin.
I'm not sure how to begin my day.
I feel hopeless, like life is gray and dreary
and that this gray dreariness is what real life is.
If this gray dreariness is real life,
maybe I don't want to live in reality.
But I don't actually believe that this is real life,
this is just my mind and emotions
causing me to think and feel this way or another.
That's an undeveloped way of putting it,
but it's what I have.
I'm glad I'll be cutting back, and successfully did so
yesterday (I truly microdosed instead of regular-dosing,
which is all too easy to do!).
I'm now going to smoke, since it's early Tuesday morn;
Once I have, I will do some yoga,
then I will answer some questions that I'm about to ask myself.

Freewriting:
Perhaps I can find joy and peace in this new daily routine.
Yoga especially will help me find myself again, I think.
