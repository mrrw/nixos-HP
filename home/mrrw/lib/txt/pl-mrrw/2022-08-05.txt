	Wow, hwo about the human brain, amiright?  It raises the question:  What are other animal brains like?
So I read an article comparing the dolphin brain to the human brain.  3 main ifferences:
	1. The human hippocampus is larger and more developed; the human hippocampus is responsible for elements of learning,
		memory, emotion, and more.
	2. The human pre-frontal cortex is more developed; in humans, this organelle controls planning behaviors,
		decision-making, and social behaviors.
	3. The dolphin cerebral cortex is larger and more developed, with much more surface area; the familiar
		folds in the brain handle motor functions and various forms of information processing.
