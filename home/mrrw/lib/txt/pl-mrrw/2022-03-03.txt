There has to be consistency.
There has to be rules, or whatever.  Right?
Like,
    What's healthy?
    What's fair?
    What's right? (is that a fair question?)

I don't even know what questions to ask.

Why do

What do I want from them?
To start getting ready by themselves at the appropriate time.
Why don't they do that?
    They want to resist parents telling them what to do?
    They don't want to go to bed?
    They don't like that the day is ending?
    They are having too much fun to stop?
Perhaps all of the above at different times.

Solutions?
    Make bedtime part of the program,
    make it their choice.
    Make bedtime a family event,
    assign roles,
    celebrate wins,
    drop the mood in the house.
    Drop the mood,
    schedule the fun (screens off at 6pm).
    Schedule the fun,
    organize the fun,
    partake in the fun,
    celebrate the fun,
    add to the fun,
    create new fun,
    enjoy the fun,
    invite others to enjoy fun.
    Schedule teh fun.  ;-)

Get off the smart phone.  It's not really good for you.

Connect dumb phone to computer?
Schedule everything,
and do it in the chest-pocket notebook.
