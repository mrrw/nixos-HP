I have seen Erie City Police in multiple scenarios.

Erie City Police responded to a call to my neighborhood in which a black man had
sauntered off with his girlfriends car keys.  She was following him and screaming
for someone to call the police.  So, we did.  Now, I approached calmly, which may
have been a mistake, because the man rounded on me, punching me once in the face.
I fell over, got back up, and followed at a distance.  When the cops arrived, I
gave them the story, and right after, they dismissed me.  When I brought up the
fact that the man had assaulted me, they dismissed me, so I walked away and let
the cops handle it, which they did without resorting to violence, even though the
man was taunting them.  They de-escalated the situation, which might have been
more difficult if I had thrust myself into it, demanding justice for myself.
