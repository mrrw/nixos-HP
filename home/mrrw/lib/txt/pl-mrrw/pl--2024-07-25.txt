Library Economy
The Library of Everything.
Housing, food

"The Ecology of Freedom," Murray Bookchin
1. usufruct
2. irreducible minimum
3. complementarity

organic society, egalitarian societies

usufruct - freedom of individuals within a society to access, but not destroy, common resources.
	tool library, furniture library, etc (borrow for however long you want, then return)
	degrowth
irreducible minimum - guaranteed access to the minimum life should provide
	food, drugs, toiletries (farming co-ops, dispenseries, housing co-ops, slow fashion co-ops)
complementarity - each person contributes...?
	some people are abled, some disabled.  Some are farmers, some are musicians.

S.R. Ranganatan, 1931
	The Five Laws of Library Science
Books are too be used.  Access is as more important then preservation.
Every person has it's book. (Individual needs are considered)
Every book has it's reader. (Broad collection is good)
Save the time of the user. (streamlined access systems)
A library is a growing, organic system.

The aim of a library economy should never be to ridgidly establish itself and then continue as-is.
A library economy must be dynamic, ever-growing and evolving,
in both the quality of collections held and services provided,
and the quantity of those who are effectively served.
The project is never complete.

Some concerns:
srsly wrong
"Will this system make us dependent on others?"  No more than we already are.
"How would we provide for everyone?"  We do have more than enough technological capacity
	to meet peoples needs, but it's not distributed fairly, and our priorities are off.
"I like owning things!  I don't want to borrow and return."
	Well, you don't HAVE to participate in the library...?
"what about scarcity?"  It's up to the community to determine
"Who administers the system?"  All of us can speak into this and help.
	Certain roles can be delegated to co-ops, such as storage and distribution.
