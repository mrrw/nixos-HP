I've learned how to set the brightness on this HP laptop using config and system files!!

$ su
# cd /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight
# cat max_brightness
	6000
# cat brightness
	6000
# echo 2000 > brightness

It's as simple as that!  Easily scriptable.

Side note, I learned about symlinks and the readlink command.
