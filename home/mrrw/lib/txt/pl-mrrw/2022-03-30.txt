i'm laying down our dreams
gently in the road
the wind runs through the reeds
the moss sits on the monuments of stone
You're staring at your screen,
I know it in my bones
there's winter in the breeze,
and pitching camp is slow-gowing, I know but
    we got this
    There's nothing 'bout each other we'll miss
    except the kiss,

We're laying in the leaves
beneath the rotting gallows on the diaz overgrown
I whisper in your ear,
your face is set in stone
a salty course of tears,
broken honor all around, on the ground,
the night is darker than I feared
we lost a lot out of the love that we found, but

        cause nomatter what, the time will come
        when one of us will have to say goodbye
            And I know that you wanna die,
            so I promise to keep on tryin'  (we got this) {solo}

    we got this
    There's nothing 'bout each other we'll miss
    except this kiss,
    and every little moment that we shared
    The time that I made you say underwear
    The do-times and the snuggles and the kids
    but we got this

    we got this
    There's so much about each other that we already miss
    Like that kiss
    and every single time I touch your ass
    and saying butt instead to show you class
    and every single 'cept the time that we team-pissed,



a salty course of tears,
the heart doth beat again
even if I never see it
and even though a pitted hearts will skip a beat now and then

without a sound
all we found
a fork in the road
I don't think there's much that we'll miss more than the kiss
a diamond in the rough


        I don't believe that
        we should sit out in the cold any longer
        there's homes all around
        The fires inside will help our hearts grow stronger
But I know we'll be never be the same

    my hands and heart are numb but you know,

i'm laying down our dreams
gently in the grass
the monuments of stone
pockmarked and dotted with moss

you make some jasmine tea
it steeps a little long
but it steeps into bitterness
as sit staring listless into eternity

the road has been so hard
we're finally at the pass
