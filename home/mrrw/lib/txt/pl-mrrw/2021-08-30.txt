I just don't know how to do anything other than be depressed
when I'm depressed.
Living with children who
    whine, scream, cry, complain...
reminding me of
  the fact that life is suffering
and we are too stuck to escape now.

We will never make it to our forest,
and if we did, it wouldn't be enough.
Nothing is good enough.
No distance is far enough.

Nathan will be content, hopefully.
Hopefully, Amelia will learn to actually love others.
Hopefully, Ben will learn that other humans exist.
Hopefully, Ben will understand how much damage he inflicts
    on the lives of others
    when he continues to live as if
    only his happiness matters.
Ben is completely wrapped up in his world,
    and there is no room for anything else.
    he is like a fast-dying king of the Old Testemant...
    living only for his own glory,
    obsessed with retaining power,
    hedonistic to a fault.
I am not cut out to be a parent.
If I knew what I know in this moment,
I would go back in time and...
...do life completely different.
I would ditch the church and live.
I would live a quiet life.
I would have time to reflect.
I would hike more.
I would grow more food.
I would live with others.
I would move out of state.
I would build my own house.
I would not have a job.
I would
I would
I would.

I cannot change anything about how life has been lived.
I cannot really change the future.
All I can do is wait out hell.

No one would ever join us.
No one could ever join us.
No one should ever join us.
We are alone.
I hate this life.
Someday, the void of unconsious will have me.
