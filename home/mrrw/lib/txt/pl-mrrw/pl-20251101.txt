I am grateful for the opportunities that the United States of America provided my family.

My mothers parents arrived on a boat from Sicily.  I can't say that their welcome was warm, but I can say they were able to make a life here.  My father was born in a house in Erie County.  He as able to travel to other parts of our country as he made his living.  He settled with his wife in Erie County, and our family has made a life here.  I am grateful for that life.  I am grateful that we have not yet been displaced:  not by natural disaster, nor by military force, nor even by economic disparity.  We are fortunate.
As time passes, I watch as my neighbors get displaced by economic disparity.  They are not moving up, they are drowning in bills.  As time passes, I watch as the State of Israel violently displaces and destroys a population of humans who had been settled for generations on the land being stolen from them.  As time passes, I watch historic towns and cities get destroyed by natural disasters.  Where is deliverance from destruction?  Where is outrage at genocide?  Where is fair judgement concerning the welfare of the people?
We speak about the 1%, who hoard wealth like it's a game.  Meanwhile, we drown inpriviledge, in entertainment, in consumerism.  Our ancestors, just two or three generations ago, were both self-sufficient and community focused.  But self-sufficiency was traded under duress for convenience over the course of one or two generations.  And community is constantly under seige.  For a strong individual can support their community, and a strong community can better resist deception, coercion, and the might of the strong man.  The strong and the brave are highly outnumbered.
