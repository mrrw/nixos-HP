Unaccompanied Child

Linnlee, eyes glazed, thought about how she could rephrase her question.  She had
been prodding the system for the better part of a half hour, but it seemed like
any useful information was coated in oil, slipping away any as soon as she was
closing in on it.  Despite her knowledge that the non-human had the information,
she didn't allow her annoyance to show.  She had to maintain her polite demeanor,
lest the entity decide she was a threat and close the conversation.  Her voice
came unassuming, as if she were truly considering the possibility of what she was
saying.
	She had been at the airport for several days now.  Her bathrobe was filthy.
Her thick, straight, copper hair was still in a loose bun atop her wide head,
though it had shifted to one side like a melting ice cream cone.  Strands had
come loose here and there, drifting in and out of her peripheral vision like so
many mosquitos.  The constant buzz of ads and entertainment around her added to
the illusion.
	She found herself watching a cat video on the screen on the wall opposite her
as she waited for a response.  Non-humans waiting on purpose, she swore.  Lord
knew how fast their processing actually was, how vast their depth of knowledge.
Yet they often seemed as slow and ignorant as a local scavenger, as if answering
basic questions was a monumental chore.  It gave a chance for the ads to push
through into the forefront of her mind:  energy drinks, non-toxic toothpaste,
insurances against mosquito-borne illnesses...  The list went on and on, and so
did the ads themselves.  One after another, it wore her mind to splinters.  She
closed her eyes, gently rubbing her ears with her fingers as she took a cleansing
breath.
	"Is something wrong?"  Linnlee's eyes snapped open.  There was a look of
panic in the androids eyes.  Linnlee forced her well-practiced smile, though she
couldn't quite make her eyes sparkle.  She was so tired, and getting frustrated.
	Her retort was warm but dismissive.  "Oh no, dear.  Just tired.  So, were you
able to find anything?"  The android returned their attention to the terminal
with a "let me see," as if they had truly been distracted from their task, as if 
they were actually concerned about a human's well-being.  She resisted the urge
to roll her eyes, knowing any sign of resistance or rudeness might cause the
conversation to come to a close.  This was too important.
	She glanced down at the little girl, who stood aloof, her wet eyes staring
furiously at nothing while she sucked her thumb, a filthy microfiber hand towel
clutched tightly in both her hands.  Linnlee wondered how long the child had been
left unattended at Eire Airport.
	
	She puffed an annoyed breath out of the side of her mouth, a mosquito strand 
of hair retreating in response.
