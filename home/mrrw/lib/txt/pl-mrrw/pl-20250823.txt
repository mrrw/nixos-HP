Unaccompanied Child

Linnlee, eyes glazed, thought about how she could rephrase her question.  She had
been prodding the system for the better part of a half hour, but it seemed like
any useful information was made of corn oil, slipping away any as soon as she was
closing in on it.  Despite her knowledge that the non-human had the knowledge,
she didn't allow her annoyance to show.  She had to maintain her polite demeanor,
lest the entity decide she was a threat and close the conversation.
	She had been at the airport for several days now.  Her bathrobe was filthy.
Her thick, straight, copper hair was still in a loose bun atop her wide head,
though it had shifted to one side like a melting ice cream cone.  Strands had
come loose here and there, drifting in and out of her peripheral vision like so
many mosquitos.  The constant buzz of ads and entertainment around her added to
the illusion.
	She found herself watching a cat video on the screen on the wall opposite her
as she waited for a response.  Non-humans waiting on purpose, she swore.  Lord
knows how fast their processing actually was.
	She puffed an annoyed breath out of the side of her mouth, her mosquito hair
retreating in response.
