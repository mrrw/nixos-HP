Unaccompanied Child

Linnlee awoke wtih a start
Her thick, straight, copper hair was still in a loose bun atop her wide head,
though it had shifted to one side like a melting ice cream cone.  Strands had
come loose here and there, drifting in and out of her peripheral vision like so
many mosquitos.  The constant buzz of ads and entertainment around her added to
the illusion.
	She found herself watching a cat video on the screen on the wall opposite her
as she waited for a response.  Non-humans waiting on purpose, she swore.  Lord
knows how fast their processing actually was.
	She puffed an annoyed breath out of the side of her mouth, her mosquito hair
retreating in response.
