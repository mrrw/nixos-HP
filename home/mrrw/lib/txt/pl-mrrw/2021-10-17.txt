make me into something
make me into something that loves
though I never knew you

make me into something
make me into something that dies
cause I'd rather live for myself than anything else

when the grass is greener
on the other side
do your best not to
just keep your focused eyes

don't bring us down
with your broken smile
or your teardrop eyes that want us to come back home to you
come back home

on the day of my stiff neck
I look you in the eye
if I can
I'll look you in the eye

on the day of my thick neck
I try to form my thoughts
if I can

Well, I stopped paying attention to your
sarcastic words and your
embittered love,
ifi you can call that love

don't know where you have been,
but I can say with some convfidence
I'm better off without you and
yuour facke-ass paridice
