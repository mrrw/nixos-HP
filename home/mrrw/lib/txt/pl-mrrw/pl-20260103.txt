#Cm Gm 
C standard, capo 1.  Key of E.

[v1]
There are those who dwell in darkness
chained down by forces everywhere
Didn't sin, they just got captured,
There's no justice, and there's no peace
But there's a God who sits on His throne far away,
and He sent His only Son
to the earth to take all our sin,
as the darkness just lives on.

[v2]
Do we need another victor?

[partial-ch] 
Beautiful, I'm rooting for you...

[v3]
In the desert, cold and burning
where the old ones used to meet
there's a treasure hidden somewhere
In this very field, underneath our feet
It's the seed of every nation,
it's the peace of every family
Simple lives with the strong but kind 
is the soil which grows the balm to broken hearts 

[Chorus]
The beautiful
I'm rooting for you
to really fall
into the arms of love again

[v4]
Strongman at the helm of greatness
is exactly whom for Jesus sent
When the meek inherit the earth
retribution will meet it's end
	no words will be needed
quiet love will flourish when we meet
apples of our eyes a-weeping
as we wash each others feet


[DISCARD]
The last thing that we need d
Suffering in great darkness
the wretched of the earth
cold and bleak with no sunrise
yet a master in the sky
will those left to rot in darkness
until each came to their end
be at peace as soon as they pass
or is this just the beginning?
suffering is a tragic pattern
It's a world of darkness hidden in a pretty box
All the sweet, strong people glittering on camera
In the light, fake smiles shine
And the way we thought was
getting us to our goal
is our mortal death
