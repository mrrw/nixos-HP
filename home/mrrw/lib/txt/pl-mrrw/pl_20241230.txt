Helping that dude build a shelter in the woods.
Which woods?
	is it close enough to walk or bus to town
	is it secluded enough with an easy path in and out
	bonus:  near water
with what?
	hatchet
	knife
	cordage
	lighters
	buckets
	tarps
	bedding
	cook pot
How often can i help him?
	
	He's not going to go for this.
	I need to scout locations.
	Am I just setting myself up for another embarassment?
