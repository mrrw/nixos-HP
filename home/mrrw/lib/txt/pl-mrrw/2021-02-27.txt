Maybe life is just depressing, I don't know...
perhaps there is no solution.


OK, I've set a vertical column in vim at row 64.  That will
make it so if I, on my current monitor setup, make two vertical
windows in I3, the colorcolumn will not show (since I only get
63 spaces).  Also, ranger preview (current setup) shows 70 rows
before getting cuttoff.  That's what I added to my vimrc config
so there.
