When the laws have been dismantled,
and the dogs have been cut loose
the sound of breaking windows
will drown all of our truths
	And all our pitted prayers
	Will cancel out that day
		With redemption so far away
Where is God when we need Him
Why don't God stand with the lovers
Has he forgot his broken babes
In the fog of moldering memories
Where the lost can't get away
	Our quilt of living dreams
	running at the seams

the gods 

A warm breeze through the window
Sunlight playing on my knees
suddenly changes come running
I miss the green lights running Peach
	Things move on, while we sing songs
	Things move on, while we make
		plans underground, in a deafening sound
	Things move on, while we make friends
	Things move on, while we build 
		life on the earth crashing to the ground.  Yeah,
		Everything ends, 'til it comes back around
Dreaming everything was 'bout to get better
Scream as I wake up late yet again
Swear I did that chore already
A swarm of junk mail flying in
