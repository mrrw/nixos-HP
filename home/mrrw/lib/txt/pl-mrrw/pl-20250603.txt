When the laws have been dismantled,
and the dogs have been cut loose
the sound of breaking windows
will drown all of our truths
	And all our pitted prayers
	Will cancel out that day
		With redemption so far away
Where is God when we need Him
Why don't God stand with the lovers
Has he forgot his broken babes
In the fog of moldering memories
Where the lost can't get away
	Our quilt of living dreams
	running at the seams

the gods 

A warm breeze through the car window
Sunlight basting the hood
when sudden changes come running
til' I miss the Peach green lights yet again
	Things move on, while we sing songs
	Things move on, while we make
		plans underground, in a deafening sound
	Things move on, while we make friends
	Things move on, while build 
		life on the earth as it falls to the ground.  Yeah,
		Everything dies, but it comes back around
Dreamed that everythings better
Waking up late yet again
swear I did that chore already
A swarm of junk mail flying
