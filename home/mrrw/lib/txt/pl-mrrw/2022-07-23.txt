	Freewriting.
{{{
	So, now I'm freewriting.  Again.  What the heck, man.  So, here I go.,
Linnea's boobies are out.  Landmine!  What if she left or died?
Would I be sad reading about her boobies?  I think so.  I think I'd get mad at my past self
for writing about it.  Freewriting, you never know what's going to pop out!  Boobies!
In other news, Linnea's mom is coming over to help with some chores.
These kids make so much work, and do so little of it.
8,7,6 years old.  Linnea has a driving urge that she has no intension to pursue:
Hunt wild boar.  Pumba.  She likes Pumba, for dinner.  For breakfast.
Also, maybe dreams and 
Is there a connected consciousness?

	Freewriting.

	Learning about the science of plants is neat!  I learned that peas, when they are getting ready to reproduce, release bacteria into the soil that fixes nitrogen into the soi.
	I don't like how vim doesn't wrap in txt mode.  Not sure how.
	Let's focus on the facts.  I don't want to say "God created dynamic ecosystems that still glorify Him today" or "Nature creates intricate ecosystems in the age-old dance of survival of the fittest," I would rather say "Plants, animals, and multitudinous life-forms and phages find themselves all mixed together.  They thrive in mediums like dirt, rock, air, water, decaying organic material, and inumerable combinations thereof."
	So manh things are happening at once.  Bacteria 
	LOL.  I be trippin today.  Just spent like 5 hours researching viruses, genome size, and how somatic cells (non-germ cells) blah blah blah blah.
