easy to feel
slow to heal
hard to obtain
fast to remain upon the shelf
{interlude}

you don't have to fight
though you have the right
you do have to fall
after it all
just one more time
you are human just like I am
we're all just living and we'll all be dying
we're dogs and cats and lambs and lions

try to escape the nightmare ride
don't hesitate to run and hide
but don't be afraid to stand and fight
don't forget:  this is your only life

easy to feel
slow to heal
hard to obtain
fast to remain
big underway
fornificate
try to abstain

try not to be late for the fight
and show up with gloves
and don't them break you on the rocks
big underway
try to abstain
been left for dead
