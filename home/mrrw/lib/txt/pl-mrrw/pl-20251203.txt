[ Ab. Eb. G7. C.
  E. B. A. Am.   ] xX
I've spent so many moments 
staring into Jesus's eyes
all while apologizing
to a God who didn't mind
The trust that I afforded
The Bible and the rest
St Calvin might have joined me
on the path away from sin
And if I hadn't faltered
And lied to my best friends
Would I lay down on the alter
And give myself again
Now I'm living for the moment
forgetting where I've been
Yet memories are an ocean
If only I could swim

At present I'm resolved to
Not give up everything

apologizing to a God who didn't care at all
The walking sea was in His eyes.
And he and I are One.
