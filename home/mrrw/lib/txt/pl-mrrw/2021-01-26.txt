Drink cheetah piss to make you mellow.
Blueberries are for dreamers, also for schemers.
Zest a lemon for a pick-me-up.

    It was the 2nd hour.
    The light of the city between
    the snow-laden ground and sky,
    a dueling set of mirrors,
    casted an iridescent glow;
    though it was dark,
    shadows were nowhere to be seen.

    The short thin man had wild eyes.
    The two cats watched from
    the stark shadows of 1st floor bedroom of
    a house built during the great expansion of
    a city built on graves.
    The comb in his sure right hand
    was supported by his left hand
    holding thick, somewhat greasy locks
    of coarse brown hair.

    Somewhat unwashed,
    he longed for a bath,
    but feared of waking his children.

    his pipe once again cold,
    he awaited the calm that was coming
    and already felt the calmer.
    Longing for holy basil tea,
    he continued working into
    the slowly awakening morning.

    He longed most of all to see his friends,
    many of which, he feared, were
    friends no longer.
    The bitter war and the deafening tide
    shook the sturdiest of allegiances.

    The cold woke him up most nights.

    Every evening now,
    he fell asleep in the bed of
    one of his several children.
    His faithful wife would often tuck him in, as well.
    He cherished her nurturing spirit
    as well as her long-suffering.

    Calmer now,
    though the tea was still
    too hot to drink.
    He took a deep breath and awaited...

    Under the desk, the scraping of
    a greasy little mouse
    gnawed at the anxious core of the man,
    who felt his calm slipping away from him;
    oh, if only for the longed-for tea...

    Faith and patience, patience and faith.

    Many things disturbed the man, unfortunately, and
    his eldest son suffered from many of the same ailments:
    difficulty sleeping;
    nervousness;
    amalgamation of the spirits...

    ...it's hard to paint a rosy picture,
    if all your colors are blue...
        Q

    He felt the posture of his mind sprawl out a bit;
    the holy basil doing it's best work.

    He wished he hadn't sent his oldest child on
    an errand,
    knowing it would be days of agony
    between now and
    the next opportunity to appologize.

    The man sighed; he had a lot to learn
    about being a father.

I'm writing.  It's time to write.
It's time to free-write.
What to write about?
How far out should I go when I'm writing in ViM?
Improved.
My life has improved.
I'm much happier now than I have been in a long time,
maybe ever.
I attribute much to cannabis, frankly.
Cannabis has allowed different modes to surface
that are normally trapped.
Because I use it more regularly, I'm able to summon
the proper mental or emotional posture to
fit the activity and setting,
thus leading to reduced anxiety.
Without it, I am a slave to the wild weather
of an uncomfortably neurodiverse mind.

Learning to type in VIm has been a treat.
It's lovely to use such a well-designed tool.
The learning curve was well worth it.
I'm a bit tired.
It's been a long day; remember when I woke up at 3:30
after an hour of light dozing?

I so want to focus on the issues pending
in my studio.
To share art, I must make art.
