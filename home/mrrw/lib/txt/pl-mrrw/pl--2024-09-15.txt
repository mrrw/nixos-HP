drawing is better than writing at some things.

Freewriting, freetyping, just keeping those brain parts lubed up.  Here we have the skeleton of the plan.  Darkness prevents it's own capture through multiple bent tendrils.  They've confiscated the light from the shadow, and all is formless.
Freewriting, freetyping.  What's the difference?  Well, maybe there is none, or maybe there is.  Nope, Didn't say anything there.  Oh gods, how I put time into such things, and for what?  All to maintain this broken body, this broken soul?  I feel it slipped away long ago.  So long have I been in the dark of the shadow.  So now, no one knows me, yes, now no one knows.
Freetyping.  We're off to a strong start here.  It's nice not to always follow the same practice, but to take the time to try a new format here and there.  And it's nice to take the time to think, to allow the thoughts to develop before committing them to paper.  
Freetyping.  But not as free as it used to be.  The restriction of red light, green light prevents me from veering off the literary road.  Not all structure is cages.
