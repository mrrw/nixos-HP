I don't know what to write.  That always seems to be my first sentence.  I branch
off from there, eh?
Bad things are happening in the USA and globally.  I'm sure you, the reader, are
already well aware of what might be happening today, Saturday, June 14th 2025.
Dui, boo dui?
Trump's birthday military parade.  Israel and Iran have entered direct warefare.
Russia is still consuming a beleagured Ukraine.  We're in for another hot summer.
And what can I do?  My panicked thoughts turn to farming, teaching, and simple
living.  I recognize that I'm missing the social element.  Perhaps music plays
a genuinely important role?  I'll keep writing and playing, anyhow.  But farming
and teaching and simple living are the direct action I can take to secure the
welfare of myself and my family.  Other priorities fall away, which feels like
a cop-out.  But what can I do??  Buy 1,000 USA flags and turn them upside-down,
giving them away at events.  Build an open source curriculum.  OR, just go to

What else?

  Wash the dishes (next).
