	Bullying, continued.
{{{
So, I've shown Ben the list in Bullying.txt.  I've explained how we will be enacting a demerit program
to stop all bullying in the household.  But there's more to do.

Dad and Mom need to retrain themselves to better handle situations as they arrive.
That means consistently and properly de-escalating.
It means not avoiding conversations or situations.
It means training ourselves to be better parents.
It means devoting ourselves as parents and protectors.
More, more more.

Mom and dad need to re-evaluate current patterns.

When Ben sullenly announces, after a fight that he started, that he doesn't appreciate our rules,
walk away.  Do not respond, even if it's tempting.
Even if you know he's wrong.
Telling him then will not help.  Let him have his oppinion.
When Amelia is crying and throwing a fit because something got decided,
Ignore or comfort her.  Do not argue with her about how it's the right thing to do,
this only invalidates her feelings.
She will not learn and suddenly feel better.
She will get more angry.  It is her anger that she struggles with.
Help her calm down.
Sacrifice your good point.  A good point with no-one to listen is not a good point at all.
A good point shoved in the face of an upset person is not helpful, it's agitating.
It will only act as a point of frustration.  The good point can be delivered
ONLY after the individual is calm and ready to receive.
SO, PLEASE don't insist on delivering good arguements at bad times.

This advice is for DAD and MOM.
Again, to recap or clarify,

	Definition of bullying.

	Bullying behaviors are aggressive, unwanted, intentional, and repetative.
	Bullying differs from conflicts in which both parties have equal footing.
