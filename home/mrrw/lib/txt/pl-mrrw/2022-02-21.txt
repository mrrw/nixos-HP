what's next?
I'm hungry, with no appeti\te.  I'm thirsty.
That's better (just drank some water).
OK,m now what?

kids were downstairs around 6:30, undressed but well-manored.
Amelia resisted going to school ("NO!  NO!  NO SCHOOL!").
Encanto music was nice and seemed to help make things
a better atmosphere.
The alarm to get dressed went off at 0740, which isn't quite
early enough?
The encanto music started at 0720

There should be an automatic announcer at 0700 saying:
"Good morning!  It's time to get dressed!"

every day could have something... idle hands are the

I got lunch with Scott (11:30?)
I've got TAS tonight, presumably.

I think I need to consider going to Cobbs and getting some
storage furniture, (such as smaller trunks), but is that
really necessary when I've got totes?
Going to Rise today, where I'll be picking up more tincture.
Not sure what else to do with myslef,
but I thinki the tincture is kicking in.  I just applied it not too long ago (about 5 minutes?).
It's nice to eat burritos.
I'm still hungry with no appetite.  C'mon tincture, make my day.
I don't wanna make music, it's hard and embarassing, or something.
