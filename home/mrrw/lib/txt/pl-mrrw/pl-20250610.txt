        Eb                  F              Bbm             
(Earth) buries itself while Sol scours the surface
    
The air is thick with pain and blame and shame
The promises of man have all turned worthless
	in the flames
Most heroes and their villains in their bunkers
Most lovers and some snitches in their graves
A matted grass of plastic on the surface
	is our fate

A tumbling mass of shreds of flags turned worthless
	in the gale
