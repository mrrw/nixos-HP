I find time is blind to
all our crying, you'd
think He'd care, but nah.
Meanwhile, Mother Nature
to her pleasure
is both life and death
I'd find time to bind with
people I admire if,
I could just make myself right.
#But then they don't seem to
#see my virtues,
they see me
	sweating as I try so damn hard
	to impress them
	#	as I undress them in my mind
	#	I'm getting tired of the monkey on my back
			serotonin syndrome better
				better then this
			so let's go together
				into the bliss
			It's the path with
				lesser risk
			I'll behave as long as
				I'm on this
			So I'll take it cause I
				want to live
					with other humans
				want to be
					in community
