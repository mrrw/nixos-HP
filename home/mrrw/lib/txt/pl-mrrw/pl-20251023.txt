Bash alias does not directly accept parameters. You will have to create a function.
alias does not accept parameters but a function can be called just like an alias.
For example:
myfunction() {
    #do things with parameters like $1 such as
    mv "$1" "$1.bak"
    cp "$2" "$1"
}
myfunction old.conf new.conf #calls `myfunction`
By the way, Bash functions defined in your .bashrc and other files are available as
commands within your shell. So for instance you can call the earlier function like
this
$ myfunction original.conf my.conf
