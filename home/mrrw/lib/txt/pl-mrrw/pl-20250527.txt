I mashed my left thumb at the main joint with a hatchet.  I am having trouble
doing a lot, but I can still type!

I got a dark tatoo, and no one can see it
I seen a bad sign in the sky, can you feel it?
Burn the sage and pray for the new scene, yeah.

	And nothing calls my name anymore,
	drifting in the murk of this misty ocean

Theres a bug bite on my leg, I can feel it
There's a chance I'll find myself on the toilet
And if'n someone kicks the door wide open
There's a chance their view of me will be broken

	Yeah, nothing calls my name anymore,
	drifting in the murk of this bloody ocean.
