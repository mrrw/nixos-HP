I've been the defender
	within the palace walls
	but I left that forever
	dead paladin
I keep scraping the pot shard
	I flinch when the boils burst 
	but keep the tears from my eyes.

I keep scraping that bowl out,
	to lift me on out, but
	paranoid is all I get
The home I'd return to
	would never let me in now
	for the muck of the pig-sty
		stuck to my skin.

	Guess I gotta do it myself,
		there's nobody else.
		'cause I can't call for help
	When will I figure this out
		get past myself
		There's fighting outside
		and I'm just sitting in the dark.

I awoke in the sickness
	that kept us all inside
	I found a love within
	my heart of hearts
Waiting for a savior
	still don't feel right
	But some homes I return to
	Don't let me in

	Guess I gotta do it myself,
		the lion is gone
		and I can't seem to call for help
	When will I figure this out
		get past myself
		There's fighting outside
		and I'm just sitting in the dark.
			So I gotta do it myself,
	Save me from hell.
		But I must confess
		I love to sit here in the dark
	When will I pick myself up,
		and ready my staff,
		and kick of the dust of the
		closet that I'm in.

I searched for my lovers,
	but could not love myself,
	I'da stayed there forever,
	but the walls blew out.
I scanned for my savior,
	and I thought I saw a lion's tail
	just round the corner
So I call out to Jesus
	and I feel peace in my heart,
	but the voices in my head
	are all my own
Yeah I call for a my saviour
	to lead me out now, but
	peace and love are all I get.
		yeah, but peace and love are all I get.
