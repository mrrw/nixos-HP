	CLEANING CLOTHES:
1) Piss in a bucket 3/4 full of steaming hot water.  Piss contains amonia,
	a natural cleaning agent.  Don't worry about bacteria, we'll rinse twice.
2) Don't be shy.  Using your hands or a stick,
	submerge the clothes into the pisswater.
3) Using your hands or a stick,
	churn the clothes firmly for several minutes.
4) Drain the pisswater and wring the clothes out.

5) Fill the bucket with cold water.  Using hands or stick,
	submerge the washed clothes. Churn firmly for several minutes.  Drain and wring.
6) Repeat step 5 until the clothes smell fresh.  Hang clothes out to dry.
	The end.

Amonia (which is found in piss) is not only a natural cleaning agent, but is also a
useful fertilizer for plants and soil life.  It's amazing that our bodies daily
produce such a beneficial substance!
