So, I basically hate all humans.
This pandemic was simply not satisfying.
I thirst for human blood

Tao Te Ching, translated by Gia-Fu Feng and Jane English.
Chapter 3:

    Not exalting the gifted prevents quarreling.
    Not collecting treasures prevents stealing.
    Not seeing desirable things prevents
        confusion of the heart.

    The wise therefore rule by
        emptying hearts and stuffing bellies, by
        weakening ambitions and strengthening bones.
    If men lack knowledge and desire, then
        clever people will not try to interfere.
    If nothing is done, then all will be well.
