Well, I did it!  I cleaned the music room and closet!  They are
now the Studio & Packout Room and Work/Weed Sanctuary.

It's grand.

OK, I need a schedule.
Let me explain.
It's hard when the weight of preceived matters of importance
press in while I'm focusing on some other matter.  So, the
pressing things should be scheduled.  For instance, I meet with
Lia Mennaker once a month, and I have homework to do (this
upcoming session, we'll be working on MY SONG, which I haven't
been able to play or write due to my thumb injury).  So what
can I do?  I sweat when I think about it... if I just
scheduled it, I wouldn't sweat so bad.
    So, how do I do it?
I don't know if typing at this level is any better, but I think
it might be too high up.  Put it back down, which is a little
better.  I'm pretty tired of typing.  All day long on these
computers.  I'ma read now.
