Let's join forces with Dave and Mandy.
What is their rent like?
and internet?>  Could I work from their place?
We could build a house for our vamily where the barn used to be.
We could pay their rent and buy really good internet, maybe.
We could hire Mandy to teach the kids.
Homeschool.  Magic school?  uh.......

I don't know how to utilize this utility.

We're having some trouble today.
Really, it's hard not to blame Amelia, who is up everyone's
butt.  But it's not actually her fault.  We're all grumpy,
which changes our perception of things.  None of us are at our
best.  If I were to play PvZ (Plants vs Zombies), I think
everyone would feel better while I play, but go manic as soon
as I shut it off.

It's been about 3 weeks since I sent my request to Justin.
He hsn't said a word.  It's disturbing and twists me into a
knot.

I don't have my stuff backed up.  It's bad.  I don't know how,
also I'm lazy.
