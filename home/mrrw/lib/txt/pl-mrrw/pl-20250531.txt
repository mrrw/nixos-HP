watching arthur with my kids.  90's stuff, super positive and pointing toward
doing good to man, working through problems, and celebating world cultures.
That's what we had.  But what about the bombs we were dropping in the middle
east, or the our part in the destruction of democracies in south america.
	I said goodbye to social media.  I don't see the need to say hello again.
