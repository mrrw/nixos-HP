I don't have use for you.

Loyalty to the teacher

Good morning.
I won't be attending church today.
The Jesus that I know won't be there either.
Just a bunch of people feeling bad about themselves
and trying to make it right by singing songs
Their ears crave gentle words
reminding them that they are loved
And they march out for the attack,

To get crosses for our backs.
And the flag flaps with a snap.
And swords come out of mouths
It's a new day

And the week rolls off their back.
