   In a lot of ways, I'm in the same place today (2025) as yesterday (2019).
That is, I must find ways to remove myself from the structures that cradle me
and utilize or craft structures that are my own or local.  Data storage being
a big one.  Google (Alphabet corp) is NOT my friend or my protector.  They do
not have my best interests in mind, only theirs.  Facebook (Meta corp) is the
same way.  Just like Windows (Microsoft corp) was a facimile of a friend with
their operating systems, and now I've found linux, so too must I divest from
gdrive, gmail, and facebook.

Speaking of such things, is it sad that Nine Inch Nails is billed to score a
Disney film?
