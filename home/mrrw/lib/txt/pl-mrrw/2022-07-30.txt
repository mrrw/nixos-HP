	Things I hate.
{{{
Picking up clothes off bedroom floors.
Picking up clothes off common floors.
Picking up books.
Picking up toys off common floors.
Picking up blankets and pillows.
Picking up papers off the floors.
Telling kids to stop rolling around in the path
Telling kids to close the screen doors
Stepping over objects, especially when they have a home.
