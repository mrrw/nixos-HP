The new funny
the new worm
working out boogers from your bloody nose

bloody nose
hardy

I suppose if I'm going to bbe writing,
I would need to be writing every
day,
or often enough
I don't suppose I'm ready
freewriting helps
sniffing butts
I don't suppose I arealyy have much to say
anyway


beholden to delicate expectations
gotta hold the hand
can't run too fast
It's torture watching you play this game

I have nothing left to process.
I've dropped it all


live laugh love
harvest is coming
wheat-head's white
turn the stubble under after,
keep next year in sight

bread grows scarce
find pure water while you still can
nothing darker than december
    in a nuclear winter

Broken land, it's gonna be alright
the sun expands long after life

mother earth,
bitter after giving birth
flood and fire and famine
mother's son
goes out with a whimper
long before that bang

Broken land, it's gonna be alright
the sun expands long after life
don't be sad about it ending
live laugh love and die



another night of caughing fits
    the sleep I get is shit, so tired of it
        look for a cure,
        that I can keep down, but I get

emptied out

        mind is gears grinding,
        fear is finding me
alone
    in the middle of the night
    alone
prayers don't seem to move the sun any faster



another night of tossing fits
I sleep like shit and the morning brings cold relief
I get no reprieve
thick, numb tongue running under unbrushed teeth
my bowels groaning as I breathe
with a rattle
(well I'm)
        looking for a cure,
        that I'll keep down, but I
        always get emptied out

Waiting through the night with satan at my bedside
Can't say I always try
to ignore his sickly-sweet lies
I'll put on my nothing face
the pace at which I breathe must be even
if I can keep breathing

        looking for a cure,
        that I'll keep down, but I
        always get emptied out

another night where every hour
from the ache inside my soul
my very bones crack under the load
when will this feeling go
If I could make this the last night,
I'll give it all I got


with every single breath


another night
another toss another turn
breath in and out and think of nothing


requires self-control beyond what I have mastered
another disaster

I'll put a nothing face on
future wife
curves and healing powers
thank you for pretending to be
your service is appreciated

a cuddle will soothe my nerves
and put me back to right
