***
    bow, gin, gone, chow, crowned, sinned, I sinned,
    jailed, zonin', jonesin', done

    battle-yard, better than, better not, battin' round

    hard against myself
    bowin' all my life
    down

Done battin' 'round reality with you

fed up
need i lie to myself
to know what you know

***
roulette of the red letters

    would the platitudes I landed
    you moved the ladder, when I landed my broken crow
    bowin' down

    what did I do to abandon,
        or don't you know

    Who did you believe I believed in
    what didn't I know that I had to know
    who did you lock up in your bunker


***
the devil and the diviner
 high on the mountain alone
  seeing up and out of
  the merry-go-round
we figured it out

***

The scars in my hands
from when I touched the splintered
source of love
