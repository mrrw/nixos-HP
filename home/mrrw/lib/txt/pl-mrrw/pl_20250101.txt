Breaking Away:  A Practical Guide to Leaving Industrialized Society.

		Preamble:  
	Is it possible to divorce ourselves from the destructive tendencies of \
industrial society?  Perhaps.  But we must understand that there are some problems \
that industrialiazed society can provide answers too, answers which may not exist \
outside of industrialized society.  Instances of modern medicine, technologically \
driven connections in computer science, and travel by way of planes, trains, and \
automobiles are just the tip of the iceburg.  However, as humans, we have a long \
history of thriving in natural conditions the likes of which modern man can barely \
comprehend.  The goal of this guide is to provide a glimps into such a life. \

Meat:  One hurdle in escaping industrialized society is acquiring proper nutrition. \
The evils of modern meat production, simultaneously inhumane and ecologically unsound, \
are seperate from the generalized evils of carnivorism.  Even as gentile omnivores, \
meat is precious in it's nutritional capabilities and accesibility.  Rabbits and deer \
are abundant, but processing meat in your backyard or living space is no easy task. \
One must find a place to spill blood and guts, scrape and tan hide, cut and store meat,
and dispose of remains.  It's good to know, therefore, that all of these needs can be \
met through our relationship with our environment.  On the disposal of remains, it is \
commonly said that our ancestors made use of every part of the animal, and that could \
well be true.  But what use are the digestive organs or blood of an animal?  \
