	Pick system isn't working.
Children do not clean, not even to get extra screen time.
They clean some, but it's pulling teeth,
hurry up and wait,
and other mechanisms that steal what's left of my sanity.


She's crying.  That was not my goal.
It is what it is.

Each day,
	each child must complete one chore in order to get their picks.
Chores should be easy, but should keep the house clean when done consistently.
For instance, cleaning room would not be a chore,
picking up all paper in room would be.
This way, each child performs one step of cleaning,
and get's their pick.
	I don't care if they help each other, 
but I also want Nathan to work.
