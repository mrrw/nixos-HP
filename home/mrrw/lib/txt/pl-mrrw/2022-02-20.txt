This most recent EP isn't as exciting as I thought....
Maybe it's alright.
"Who cares"


Drums into the attic.  I don't even freakin care.
#All other unused instruments, too?  Nah, just drums. for now.

so, I've moved a few things around
I've now got the laptiop back in the closet.
Is this the elevator going down?
Not an important question.
Feels ok in here.  I'm hungry
for food, but have no appetite.
I'm thirsty as well.
I have no desire to interact with my kids, and no idea how to.
I wish to establish regular family meetings.
Try to not have an ego about it.

I forgot how nice it is to be in here
in this little closet.
Big enough for one!
I could live in here.
That's what I thought for a whole year,
but I didn't make it out with my mind.

Now here I am again, but it feels like it's on my terms because
I'm hiding from my children and the outside world

I put all the unused instruments oin the attic afterall.

Hanging out with Jes instead of smoking pot?
Hanging out with Jes is someting I did a lot
Just round the bend, maybe we'll meet a lot again
but I think not.

Being in here gives me protection from the noises.
All the noise, visual, spacial, and aural.
But I live in a prison.
This closet is a prison, I remember now.
I was stuck here for about a year, but I don't quite remember
quite how long anymore.
Every day, I pounded away at the various tasks before me,
now I idle here.
I'm so ashamed to be taking care of myself.

No.  There is no reason to be ashamed.
I had to leave.
I must deal with my own shit.
Sure, it could be ripped from me, but I am,
at times at least, a man of action.
I may not be perfect (or even close, I'm sure)
but I must not give up.
ego ego ego
leggo my ego
