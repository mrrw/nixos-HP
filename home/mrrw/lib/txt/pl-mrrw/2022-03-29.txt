tempo/pace: a little slower than "Sultans of Swing"


you got the mark of the beast and you're damned
do you even understand what I mean
all the information in the palm of your hand
demanding "look at me, look at me."
It isn't easy to turn away from idolatry
please forgive us, LORD
every comfort and convenience is a dependency
that our souls cannot hope to afford

We don't like to talk about the things that we see
when we're giving ourself a squeeze
subdued in person lust is a slippery beast
when it's got ya beating off to a screen
little light under a bushel is a waste of everybody's time
when it's made up of blue light
better to cut off your hands and pluck out both of your eyes
though you'd be happier dead than blind

if the skin on your wrist and forehead is already taken,
they'll just mark you somewhere else.
Is the sin that they make you suffer for
still make ya feel like hell?


if the skin on your wrist or forehead is taken,
they'll just mark you somewhere else.
Is the sin that they make you suffer for
still weighing on your mind?

six six six can go wherever else
six six six will go wherever else you'll take it.



A, C#, B, A, E
C#m, G#, A,

sevens sins cover basically what you are doing with yourself

Save your skin a little bit of ink on your forehead
bow it down and worship Christ the King instead

as you lower your eyes


Try to cop a beati


you got the mark of the beast and youyr damned
a slave to the beast
but at least you get to be yourself as your
turned into ham
access to never-ending salty-sweets

it's hard to watch humanity willingly serve the machines
feeding the ultra-wealthy rich
just a fish inside an ocean that's patrolled with the means
to feed and feed and feed and feed


a whole palace in the palm of your hand
you're not even listening
