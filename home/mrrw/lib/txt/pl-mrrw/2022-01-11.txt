America is boiling
the earth has a fever
polution and greenhouse gases
Does any of this stick?
I don't talk about climate change,
but my 8-year-old remembers every god-damn christmas
and he knows it right when a christmas ain't white
and we're stuck with all this bullshit
some of it's fun, but a lot of it's bad
and all if stinks like shit, and everyone knows it
but people like that smell, and we all know who they are,
and they are
anti-fa, we're comin' for you,
q anon ya know it.
Democrats don't talk what they walk
Republicans ya'll showing.
Bush in the house was a grand ol' time
and everybody miss it.
antifa is coming for you,
ta give ya hugs and kisses.
