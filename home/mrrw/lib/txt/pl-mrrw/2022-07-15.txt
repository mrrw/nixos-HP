	tried starting picks (video's) early if kids cleaned.
Only Benjamin cleaned.  He got stuff done!
The whole house did not get cleaned.


Priority is a necessity.  Should it be by rotation or earned?
	probably by rotation.  Keeps things fairl.
choice of each thing is good.

Telling them there's work to do doesn't motivate them.
Being angry at them can motivate them,
	but also leads to fear, resentment, confusion (a complication of fear)
Carrot-and-sticking pick or outings creates more pressure on me,
	while also requiring a large part of my time and energy, somehow.

Trying to divide who gets the most pick time doesn't work on Video days.

	What do I want done by 2pm?
Clear livingroom floor.
Clean craftroom.
Clean backyard.

	Things that take over when not done on reg:
clean bedrooms.
