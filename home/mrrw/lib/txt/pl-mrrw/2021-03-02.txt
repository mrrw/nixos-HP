Well, I am a butt.
I don't even like to be a butt, I just kinda am.  Benjamin
Oh boys, I'm so tired of sensitive fights.

OK, I've got some headphones on.  I really hope that helps.
My ear buds are about busted.  They don't quite fit in my phone
anymore, and they're turning green, aging on the inside from
some kind of copper illness.

I've got some rock music in my head,
it's blocking out the noise of my kids
I want my band again
I want to die again
I want my fans again
I want to try again
I want you out of my fucking face
I want out of this place
I want to be ok again
I want to fade again
I want my face again
I want a place of my own

When you get to heaven
with all the good people
don't forget asbout me
Just a drink of water is all that I need
Rebel against god
who just wants you to forget
about all the damned
He says:
"don't worry about them, my child
Just focus on me
I'm the most beautiful thing
you've ever seen"
If you are perfected,
and I am still damned,
just reach down your heart and your hand
