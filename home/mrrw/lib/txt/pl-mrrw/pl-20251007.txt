Resist evil.
What is evil?  Is it an entity?  An action?

What did I say?
I justified my lies and my hate
How to do about face
unto this world of dark and light?
The grief and hope both make me blind

Why can't I stay?
I go silent or walk away, until I think about grace
and find my voice and my place in this world
As long as I remember

Watch what you say
Keep your ear to the sky
Hold each other close
'Cause we still have a moment

Listen for birdsong
send praise on high
And hold each other close
'Cause aren't we all still human

As long as we remember


At the core of who I am
neither woman nor a man
Just a child of Endless Love
Just a child of God Above

What released out of my head
When I clutched at what I had
All the darkness that I felt
at the core of who I am

What relief now that I'm dead
To the life I couldn't have
To the world I seem to live
as a shell of what I've been

When my grief let out its breath
And my sorrow seemed to pass
turn a cheek out once again
and the past is hard to remember

When I seek that path again
All the morals that I lived
Will the world still even care
'bout the evil that I did
What relief, peace in my head

I don't ever want to talk about gender again.
I still don't quite know how people see me, and I think it depends.
I know it depends on what I'm wearing.
It depends on how my face looks,
which depends on age, mood, and coverings.
My gender is how I feel.
My sex is what I was born with.
My gender is how others see me.
Or is it?  But my experience is heavily modified by how others treat me.
If I, a human with lots of facial hair and a penis,
wrap a colorful garment around my waist, let my hair down,
put a mask on, and dance gracefully,
how does this change my gender, if at all?
How does it change peoples perception of me?
But maybe that's not the problem.  Maybe it's the things I've said.
Stances I've taken. (social stances, not so much physical ones)
Stances I've failed to take.
With some, it absolutely is how they percieve you (masculine, feminine)
But not all!  Some might hate me for not supporting the police, etc
Or some might hate me FOR supporting the police!
I don't think I can make things right, can I?
Maybe I could reconnect with some people, but what do I care?
What do they care?
I should, of course, for my own sake.
