freewriting'
OK, I'm freewriting.  Not smoking cannabis every morning anymore.
Smoked yesterday (saturday) which had mixed results.
Sundays are a day off cannabis unless I'm having an anxiety attack.
I do not love this life.
I wish this world would end, the suffering end
I do not love my blankets.
I do not love my desk.
I do not love my house.
I do not love my family.
I do not love my city.
I do not love my forest.
I do not love my lake.
I do not love my sky.
I do not love my butt.
I do not love my weiner.

I'm in a grumpy mood, and it's hard to say what came first,
the chicken or the egg,
the grumps or the hate.
the disappointment...
the intollerance of pain...
Seriously, I cannot stand that this entire existance is base on entropy.
Scott said the other day how it's dumb that the entire universe is based on entropy,
and I agree.
Like seriously, what the hell God?
and sin has nothing to do with it.
If entropy is due to sin,
than God sinned first.
God is in control, right?
God created the entire universe?
And now were going to try and make it so that man's "sin"
somehow caused all the laws of the universe to be
completely rewritten so that entropy is
a fundamental building block of it all?
entropy is suffering.
Not really, though.
entropy only causes suffering when
our desire lasts too long.
Suffering is existing outside of what we desire.
So, suffering can be mitigated if we jettison our desires.
...but really, who wants to do that?

Linnea just used a bunch of alternative flour inste4ad of weat flour
in the pancakes.
hope it turns out,
but it probably won't
hope she can jettison her fucking desires.

into numbness
into complete and perfect emptiness

"well you can't make god die"
and i would say the same
that they should not be smug
