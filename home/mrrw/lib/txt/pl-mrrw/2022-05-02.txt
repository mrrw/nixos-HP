what shohld I eat?
Apl-oe apple:  did that
chease- did that
cereal?
pankackes?
I'm hungry and sick with covid, in case you think I'm just stoned, which I'm not.


I was up above, in the holy huddle
I knew exactly who I was and what I was worth
And as I climbed, I found a great lie
that something inside me knew would bring me down to earth
But I didn't tell myself, that I'd go through hell
I plummetted when I let go of all control
He didn't take the wheel, like I knew that I knew that I knew he would
I hit the dark concrete below, just me and her

We grew in the cracks in the old, old ground
We knew what we lost, but not what we found
We had to trust ourselves to find the way
We had to move by night, and watch by day

Unfamiliar territory, in a blasted land
It isn't what they said it would be,
to live among the damned

I had a hand in torching my spiritual house
I had enough of acting like it was ok
Built on sand, it crumbled with a crash
all the sticks and straw were ready for the blaze.
Wearing nothing but a kilt and shawl,
I pitched my tent on the concrete page
I felt the ground, and stared up in the sky
I became the home I wanted all along.

But now I find I'm trembling,
my weary rattle-bones.
Is it just covid again,
Or do I feel the rapture coming on?

If I'm my only friend,
These burdens will be the end of me,
If I could stop pretending I don't need anyone else

Every human that I know has been domesticated, including me.


It take a village to keep me going
But I keep moving out of town,
and people here can't get to know me
Danger, beware of dog, keep out

And what if only I should suffer,
No family, no harm no foul
But my van is crammed with kids and a wife,
so I gotta figure out how I can cope with this life

I'm tired of stumbling 'round in these shoes
Even when I change them, they always fit loose.
I get so hungry, had communion before,
I cross my arms aloof at the sancuary door.



Sandles last forever, pray the manna down
Blame God for the exile that no-one tried to choose.





Made of thach and cob, no gold or iron remain




So, I have no idea how to live.
The cake is relevent to the story.
Here's the picture of me
shrugging

Here are those brownies I was trying to make the other day,
