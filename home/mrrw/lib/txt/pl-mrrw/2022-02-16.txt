What could I do today?
    listen to music
    eat more, how about lunch?
    pick up livingroom
    call somebody
    take a capsule, but when?
    go exploring
    comb my hair
    think out loud
    anthony, remember anthony
    become someone that the world wants to see
    become something striking
    interact with a human, any human
    learn about linux
    keep typing on vim, that's learning linux
    read a book

I'll be typing for SSA again soon.  I don't wanna.  I wanna be
me.  I can't be me there.  Not really?
I still haven't learned how to use options trading software.
I haven't talked to my dad in over a month.
