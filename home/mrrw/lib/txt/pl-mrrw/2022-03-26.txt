when I finally see
what it means to be
a modern human

When the heart grows still
the final

When the final beat
of


If I

When I look around
at the place I found
and all the people


Every fish I cought]
every brain I found

I don't have wnything to say
I'm just a farmer
a family man


It's not like I say a lot

I don't say a lot these days
I don't pray at all,
Cause I don't need to hear it to make it happen

I don't pray anymore
I don't need to knock at anybody's door
The spirit answers me
with dancing in my boney body

My eyes are open

Idon't need you anymore
You were never really real to begin with
I just made you up to hurt myself



the ring on my finger
tells of the time
I met a girl and she was mine

The fire outside my shelter
reminds me of better days


The end of days

thorns in the field
generations of sharp quiet things
are slow to yield
Last years defence
Is this years opportunity,
a fertile patch of strawberrys underneath
go slow, aim true,
hacking and slashing will tire you out,
don't bring me down,
don't scream or shout
don't write down my name or number,
I don't care anymore,
sick and at death's door
my own allegory isn't coming together,
so I'll borrow from others.
and if you mind bloody fingers,
it's good to move slow
breath and watch and gently bring 'em down
I don't know how long they been there


I broke when I hit the bottom
the barrel scraped when I got 'em

mhy teeth bite
what they think is the bread of life
my soul white
with the human's truth

my heart hurts
with all their smiles
muscles jerk,
I dance the dance prescribed

my mind bought
the package deal of Christ
My heart wanted
to beacon out the light


Circle tight,
faces in the light
Dollar bills
had no say in our relationship
Friends for life
until they saw my stripes


their light is all they see
    trade my will
    to incriminate myself
lips sealed tight, I trembled in the light
    shepards coo
    to calm all attitude
shears find sheep who wait without a bleat
    silent now,
    the bell toll on the hour,
All the talk, the prayer the shout the weep
    bardo state
    eyes closed as I wait
in this place, I find true clarity

I never needed God


The one true God has revealed myself to me

I won't talk about that God
The untrue Christ in charge of all I see
The devil hates true agony
the crucible of all our dreams


Walk on without a staff to guide
rely on ears and eyes
