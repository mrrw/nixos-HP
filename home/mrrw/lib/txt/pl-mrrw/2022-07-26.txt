Before we were even really human
Dark and Ice Ages intertwine
	.interlude
Grass and people,
barely dogs and apes and cats
growing up together in the past
	Under sun and the moon
	So many moons
		Don't need to care about anything
		Just stay alive and have fun working together
		Don't need to care about anything at all
What a wonder it must have been
When those ages finally passed
	Discovery of grass
Kinda human, curiosity of cats,
protodog our best friend
	It has yet to end
	Been so many moons

We stepped into the new grass
Cats became cats, people settled down,
dogs became our best friends
	.interlude
Grass got fat and tasty, men and women planted it.
then got attached, to fat and tastey life.
	Forgot sun and moon
	been so many moons
