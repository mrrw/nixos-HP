So, I'm trying to create a wellness program in my house.  Take care of the house needs
	How about the music room?
let's say:  We can earn 10 points a day, which would go toward family vacations and outings.
Outings would be decided by family, though parents have veto power.

Attic needs to be cleaned, basement cleaned, piles in livingroom cleaned, bottom of stairs cleaned, porch cleaned.
