	Freewriting
{{{
There's just no way I can do this.  Another day, another morning.
Woken up by children, sorry if you['re reading some negativity.
Damn athe man, intersteller deeds go unnoticed by the arpegio dreams
of man.  My brain is dying here, I guess that's the way it is
with pot and kids.  At least I dose my Lexapro, at least I eat 
yogurt w/ berries.  It's not the best life, not the worst.  Kids get
too play, so that is good.  My life for theirs, it's worth it
though I fight it.  My ego fights.
	I'm filled with negativity.  Not really, but it's in my mouth
and the front of my mind.  I'm freewriting to save my soul.
My soul has died since Jesus took his place in time.
His story is history.  My life is bland, my joy is diminished,
and other things that would garner an "I told you so" I'm sure.

	VS1
Friends of mine, hang out in my mind;
conversation's dry as hell
but sometimes, through my window blinds,
catch the talking
behind my head.

	CH1
How I shake when they break out all my secrets;
It makes me scream out loud.
	CH2
...and I hate how you're portrayed,
or how I manage to play dead,
	TAG
	when the real you comes around.

	V2 (instrumental solo)

	CH1
How I shake when you break thru
	all my weakness;
Can't fake another smile
Don't watch me break when they shake my
	box of secrets
I'll see you in awhile

	CH2 (long instrumental solo)
	(breakdown)
...Before I start... I end
I'll be absolutely nothin' if I'm not a good friend
something in the way my brain can't make this work
keeps me wishing for words from the real you
so I'll sit  and listen to your words
I don't know what I must do, I don't know what I must be,
I don't know what question I need to ask to solve this mystery
I don't know what I must do, I don't know what I must be,
I don't know what block to pull, and the tower is teetering.
I don't know which block I pulled but the tower's coming right down on me
	TAG, extended:
Then the real you comes around
I hope you realize
though I don't want to be found,
the real you could find out
So try to dig into my mind,
I'm afraid I'm trapped inside
if you put the damn screen down
When will the real you come around,
When the real you comes around?
