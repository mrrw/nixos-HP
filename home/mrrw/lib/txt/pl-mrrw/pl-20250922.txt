Dead to the World
--Michael Milk

C                      Eb           Ab              Bb                C
	I'm dead to the world, and my suffering is      what I thought I needed,
          Ab
but now I rest at peace
Cm                     Gm           Ab              Bb                Cm
            	I fell in      to a buried place, I found my face    scattered
        Ab        
on the floor

C                      Eb           Ab              Bb                C
I'm dead to the world, and my prophecy is what killed me off
          Ab
swirling around my head
Cm                     Gm           Ab              Bb                Cm
        Ab        
Fade away to a better place, lost in space
Not without my friends
floating like blood in the body

Not without my brothers and sisters x2

The boys and the girls,
They all share a space and have their place for sure
In the body of Christ
Some are blood to be bled upon the word of God,
Some are the eyes, and some are blind seers

I was girded in loin,
one of many arrows quivered in the sheath,
ready to release
But we stayed on the cusp of love and back again,
What are we waiting for, but for his second coming. 

I'm dead to the world, and I've got nothing to talk about
Nothing but what is of the world
I could stay for a million years and still have fear,
When I reach that door
Will I have the courage to enter

I'm dead to the world,
and I'm dead to YHWH and to Christ,
Jesus Christ, that is
Have I found the true Gospel, all-consuming doubt?
Nothing is for sure
When there's so many teachings
Either, or I'm the sheep that God forgot about,
Nothing is for sure
Nothing is for sure

Not without my brothers and sisters x3
but the flock moved on

I'm dead to the world, and the least that I could do is die
If I am to earn my place in the mind of the living

I've too many fears to get out there.





But I'm dead to the world 

, shattered
        Bm
on the floor
I'm one of the spoils,
one of many talents buried in the field
for two-thousand years
