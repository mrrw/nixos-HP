Dead to the World
--Michael Milk

C                      Eb           Ab              Bb                C
	I'm dead to the world, and my suffering is      what I thought I needed,
          Ab
but now I rest at peace
Cm                     Gm           Ab              Bb                Cm
            	I fell in      to a buried place, I found my face    scattered
        Ab        
on the floor

C                      Eb           Ab              Bb                C
I'm dead to the world, and my prophecy is what killed me off
          Ab
swirling around my head
Cm                     Gm           Ab              Bb                Cm
        Ab        
Fade away to a better place, lost in space
Not without my friends
floating like blood in the body


	v1
I'm dead to the world, and it's not as bad as what I thought it'd be,
anxiety
I'm ok, I'm just treading water 'til the end
Nothing is for sure, but
what's new on this planet?

	v2
I'm dying for sure, and what's after I would like to know,
the Bible told me so
many things that I thought were true, but many grew
inward like a nail
many friends that watched as I leapt and fell to death
as far as they know
still tryna to put myself back together

without my brothers and sisters x1

The boys and the girls, they all share a space and have their place for sure
In the body of Christ
Some are feet, spread the word of God to folks at work,
Some are hands that serve; the rich, the poor, and the needy

I was girded in loin,
one of many arrows quivered in the sheath,
ready for release
We stayed on the cusp of love and death and then
embers blown away to light the whole earth on fire

But what of my light?  What of everything I do for those I love
and those that come my way?
Is it lost in the dark of all I fail to do?
Will I have to pay for snuffing out?

without my brothers and sisters x2

I'm dead to the world, I've got nothing left to prove and that's for sure,
fit to be destroyed
But I'll stay and I'll keep my open ears and eyes
nothing is for sure.

I'm dead to the world, and I don't have much to talk about
that isn't of this earth
I could stay for a million years and still have fear,
When I reach the door
Will I have the courage to enter

without my brothers and sisters x3
but flocks move on

I'm dead to the world,
and I'm dead to YHWH and to Christ,
Body of Jesus Christ, that is
But have I found the true Gospel, all-consuming doubt?
Nothing is for sure
When there's so many teachings
Either, or I'm the sheep that God forgot about,
Nothing is for sure
Nothing is for sure

Not without my brothers and sisters x3
but the flock moved on x?



I'm dead to the world, and the least that I could do is die
If I am to earn my place in the mind of the living

I've too many fears to get out there.





But I'm dead to the world 

, shattered
        Bm
on the floor
I'm one of the spoils,
one of many talents buried in the field
for two-thousand years
