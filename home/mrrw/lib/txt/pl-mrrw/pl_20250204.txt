Christianity is a complex beast.  While it gets much negative press lately, there are many under-the-radar services to the poor and needy, and so many kind and compassionate individuals serving out of love.  In the very same church, you'll find these lovely individuals co-existing with bigots and narcissists, struggling with and often against them.  

Don't get me wrong, christianity often becomes a vehicle of massive violence like your post suggests.  Christianity itself is not to blame, but corrupt or incompetent organizations.  Christianity has been hijacked by to further the ends of powerful individuals, and many christians have been lead down a dark path by many shepherds (from local pastors to Franklin Graham, Fox news, you name it).  When people commit to dying on the hill of their faith while devoting their loyalty to any human leader or metaphysical being, they might find themselves ushering in facism and enabling abusers if they picked the wrong one.  Let's not cast out those who chose wisely, I say.

Some of my most hospitable, truth-seeking and people-loving friends are christian.  They eat crow for being christian now-a-days, and that's not right.  You might even find some of them on your side, as long as they can forgive posts that, intentionally or not, put a target on their back.
