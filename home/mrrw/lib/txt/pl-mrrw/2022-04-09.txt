There's nothing I can say
To change the way the day
    challenges the frame of our marriage certificate
It isn't a huge deal yet,
    but in the future, mind yer step
    I can't forget to keep you in the loop

        I die for you
        Everytime I appologize
        I die before, I'll die again
        I'm guilty of sin
        I've gotta die, I've gotta give myself away
        I'm gonna die for real someday
        might as well do it now (meh)

There's thorn's and slugs and snakes
We can work our way through
    If we go real slow we can have a good time of it

        You die for me
        Every time you gotta catch up
        You die'd before, you'll die again
        I'm guilty of sin
        I've gotta die, I've gotta give myself away,
        There's nothing I could ask of you to change
            So I'll change what I can

            Atlas shrugged, and you fell off
                the face of the world
            Live with me and you get
                treated like a piece of furniture
            Try to keep up but everyday brings
                confusing changes
            Fire-flies light in the dark,
                everythings shuffles around, I...
Digging in the middle of the nark
weeds die silently as I put my e-tool
in the throat of soft bark,
thorns scratchin my arms
wolves all around on the prowl with a growl
and a snap they pulling me down, and they bite real hard


The goal of each day
is to work real hard, and to treat ya'll right
but the fall is long, and I'm afraid of heights
If I step this way, if I get enough space if I dose just right,
I simply might
live a perfect day
If I build that streak
If I walk that tight-rope for the whole mile,
and live a balanced life, I'll make valleys and peaks
maybe someday
    I won't feel so frantic, like all of the time
    I won't get into a panic just by calling a friend
    All of life can't be estatic and then tragic,
    gotta find the perfect balance between life and death
    I don't wanna live each day like I'll have another
    Brothers and mothers on crutches everybody suffers
    so I gotta take on as much as I can for my fellow man

Gotta live by day, gotta love by evening and sleep by night
Gotta dig by dark, gotta cry in the dirt, and smile by light


The goal of each day
is to put on my tie and to make it real tight

The goal of each day
is to be awake, and to tye my lace, my boots and my face.


If I don't face death, I lose the moment
I gotta face death, every moment I'm alive
then to work
then to task-hop till I get to bed, and don't end up undead
The goal of each night

Digging up thorns in the dark, spade in the ground,
try not to fuss as they scratch up my arms



In the dark, in the dark,
In the dirt, in the pit,


            and I'll do it by myself
            I don't want anybody's help
            I've been alone for so long
            just me and my moral compass

            I wish I could fuse with a friend
            but I gotta big crack in my gem
            I been alone for so long
            I'm just a leg and an arm.

            It's not like they don't try
            It's not like like I don't try

    But we live on different planes
        with peaks and valleys
    Where can we find the blame
        with all these worldviews intersecting
    All the time and effort
            wasted on a game.
    Maybe we'll find a way
        to love each other
    to co-communicate
        one to another
    We'll do it face to face
        and help each other along

            Can't blame you for rolling your eyes,
            I do it to everyone all the time.

I gotta appologize,
to make this go away
