lyrics

Bincoff'
due write the veristate.
the state of things you never ate
undu th e basic intellect
you never saw a change
you thought youd' rearagen me
Fucked up against teh last night

Prayer didn't get me closer
No
my supplecant ran dry
And if my everafter is a disaster
It's obvious why

Verbatim I spoke mild prayers
And adlibbed fire and might
and neither got me closer
to knowing wrong from right

If knowledge was the apple,
than ignorance is bliss

Who can pride themselves
on moral compases
Not true followers
that;s for sure

If we found ourselves in the state
as if we never ate of the fruit
we'd be like the animals
