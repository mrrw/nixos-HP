I have friends.  I really do!!
The year 2021 will be the year that I attempt to reconnect.
Thankfully, with 2020 being what it was, I now know more about myself,
and more about people whom I thought were friends that apparently aren't.

Let's brainstorm some of the friends I have left:
* Kelley Wendt
* Jeremy Prichard
* JJ
* Scott
* Mike Kemp
* James Chandler
* Kat Wolper
* Zac Hatch
* Katherine Brightbill
* Todd Steffy
* John Evans
* Tim and Catherine
* Jaime Charini
* KT
* Richard Varner
* Bryan Boleratz
* Jason Kelley
* Jason Lalowicz
* Tony DiPlacido
* Amy Miles


Brainstorm some ways we can connect with these peeps:
* Voice calls
* Text message
* eMail
* Zoom meetings
* Face-to-Face, family visits
* Facebook (what even, tho)
* Instagram (posts, DM voice/txt/vid)

Brainstorm how I could show (and even develop!) interest in other people:
* follow them on social media;
* ask them questions;
* log conversations, recording things such as
  - interests,
  - birthday/anniversary,
  - current events (such as work, family, and personal goings on),
  - needs;
* develop gift ideas;
* learn their schedules and routines for planning puroses;

Face-to-face is problematic during a pandemic, but maybe worth the risk?
There's a lot to unpack there.

I also am not necessarily interested in rekindling these friendships.
I have to be interested.  Not sure how to make myself interested.
Some of these are simply friends, we don't necessarily have a lot in common
with all these peeps.  There's loyalty there though, and I've not honored it.
Some of those flames may be still burning; some may have reduced to a tiny
ember; still others may have suffocated entirely.  All must be addressed.

Some of these relationships are a lower priority than others; some are harder
for me to tolerate.  These and other nuances will determine how I address them.

Real life example:  I could text Zac Hatch and ask him if he has plans for
New Years.  I could then schedule time on my calender to visit him, maybe make
it a family thing.  We could then visit, spending time together.  Win!

Another one:  I could text ask Bryan Boleratz, asking about his pain issues.

Another one:  I could learn the anniversary of Kelley Wendt's miscarried child,
whom she named Tyler.  I could send condolences each aniversary, using my
calendar as a reminder.

I could answer when Jason Kelley calls and find dates and times that we're
available for a play date.  Actually, I'd have to call him, appologize for going
AWOL, then ask what kinds of things they've been up to lately.

I could post more about my interests on my personal instagram;
I could then stalk Jeremy Pritchard's Instagram and, using IG DM, strike up
conversation about overlapping interests.

One problem that I tend to have is that my social life is dictated by my moods.
For weeks or months, I have zero social spoons; then I "can't stop doing the thing"
once I start socializing and burn myself out.  So, I have to find methods of
socializing that mitigate the difficulties that I deal with.

Brainstorm for mitigation techniques:
* Smoke pot!  lol;
* write and schedule messages according to the recipients schedule;
* write a file for each person for easy tracking of issues and opportunities;
* log all conversation attempts for self-confidence and diagnostics;
* use the tools you have (phone, computer) to coordinate with your brain;
*

On to other things.
Living the lifestyle... I'm getting closer all the time.
