	Nothing today.
just, don't think it's going to be ok, you know?
like, three times 5 is fifteen, you know?
each bean gets sliced in half, you know?
you know, you know?
Nothing to read here, just free-writing.
Free-writing is simply typing or writing words in a stream,
just letting the brain create sentences.
Don't think about it too hard, just let the words come forth
Let the words come forth.
Don't stop to think.  just keep writing
if you make a mistake, just keep writing.
Pretend like the words you write are like writing on the sand
like you're writing with your finger in the sand,
jand the tide is coming in to sweep your words today.
Your words on the page is the product of your free-writing,
But the product is not important.
The process of free-writing is what's importanty.
And it's ok if you practice some bad habits in your free-writing,
don't go back an d correct it.  Just keep going.
This is excercise.
Take not of your bad habits.  Write about them, even!!
I hit backspace when freewriting, but that can interupt my think-flow.
But it's whatever.  I don't like considering things too hard while they're happening,
like it makes me doubt myself and I freeze up.  Just keep typing.
Search the mind.  Let yourself fall, don't get caught up in the swirl of critical and amuzing thoughths
