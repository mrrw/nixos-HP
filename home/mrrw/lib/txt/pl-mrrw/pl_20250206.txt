According to Dani Trewhela on FB:

"It's funny that I moved to Erie from a major city. In that city there were very few rules on chickens. You just could not have like over 4 or 6, I think, which was more than enough to feed a family. However, Erie, a small, danky town won't? Is the "city" of Erie going to reduce the prices of eggs and make sure that we have enough for everyone? Yeah, I didn't think so... if you are caught, you will be hit with a fine and possible jail time up to 90 days. 
Yet you can have up to 5 in Pittsburgh, 6 in Portland, and as many as you want in Chicago and Columbus (with permit in cbus) to name a few... 
It's about time you get some outsiders in here to improve this place and not just with this. I see a town that has a lot of potential with a lazy population, who just care about the bottle, gossip, drama, and who they are fking tonight. And don't pull the "you can just move" card. We are but it is sad to see the wasted potential. I still have friends and family that will never move out of the town of Erie. This could be an awesome place."

So, chickens in Erie.
