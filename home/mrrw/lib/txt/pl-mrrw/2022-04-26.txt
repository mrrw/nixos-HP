not a good day for the woods, I want to say
I just wodon't want to, is all

it's gone be chilly today, but other than that is a good day.

Everytime I want to visit the woods with someone,
I must tell Mina.
I don't want to make this a hassle or a burden, \
and I don't know how much they wanna do
how much they can take
I don't want to be rejected.
I don't want this fire to snuffle

I'ma say "no" to the woods for now.
I just brought Todd over a couuple days ago.
Give it some silence.
