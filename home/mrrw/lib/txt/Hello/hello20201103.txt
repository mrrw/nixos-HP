###     YESTERDAY:  Shitty Monday.  Did not get work done.  Got work dumped on me.  I shouldn't take it personally.  School went well; Ben showed
###                 excellent self-control.  Cooked some good lunch.  Did not get to work on TMF album.  Chatted with TMF, which was fun.
###     
###     TODAY    :  Tuesday.  Up early; will smoke, but feeling weird about that.  Don't want to talk with Linnea about how often I smoke on the days
###                 I smoke, which might have something to do with how weird I feel.  I don't feel as if the volume I smoke is an actually problem.
###     
######  TOMMOROW :  Wednesday.  Another day working with 205.  Hopefully I'll have made some progress with TMF album by tomorrow.  I wonder if there's
######              a special occasion, such as someones birthday, on Wednesday?  I don't keep track of such things.

###     PILE OF GOALS:  TMF album; songs with Kemp; talk to Linnea about smoking frequency; arrange pick up of items from JDB; connect with JDP on
###                     personal things; take a walk; replace the sink; buy bales of hay; start plastering the attic; eat some food (so hungry rn!)
###       
###       SO HUNGRY RN:  I wish I enjoyed cooking food in the morning, but I don't.  What ways can I alter my morning routine that will help with this?
###       TALK TO LINNEA:  I don't want to clear every hit with her, but I don't want to smoke behind her back.  Where is the line?
###       ARRANGE WITH JDB:  I'll have to check the texts for hints on what the future holds.  Look before you speak!  :-)
######    PLASTER ATTIC:  Hold your horses!  First thing's first:  Start buying hay (which can be stored in attic).  Then, think about insullating.
######    SONGS WITH KEMP:  Just press record, the more the merrier.  Don't forget to get back with Kat and her stunning lyrics!

######    PEOPLE I WANT TO CONNECT WITH:  Omar Rodriguez-Lopez; Kat Wolper; KT Miller; Nathan McCarty; Kaitlyn Wolfberg; Trent Reznor; T
######            MUSIC THAT I LONG FOR:  Gorillaz; Cap'n Forever; the sound of the wind in the trees; pole bang; chimes; Bella singing...
###         THINGS I WANT TO DO SOMEDAY:  Eat mushrooms with someone; give gifts that matter; eat breakfast (so hungry rn!); find an artefact
###      HOW I WOULD LIKE TO BE TREATED:  Like they actually trust me, and as if I'm a reliable person.
###     WHAT I'D CHANGE ABOUT YESTERDAY:  Although yesterday was kind of shitty, I don't think there's much I'd change.  Hug Linnea more.
###       WHAT I'D KEEP ABOUT YESTERDAY:  I handled all situations well to the best of my ability!
######          WHAT I WANT TO DO TODAY:  Be free and clear of conscience as I smoke.
######      HOW I WANT TO FEEL TOMORROW:  Fucking accomplished (lets try this again!).
