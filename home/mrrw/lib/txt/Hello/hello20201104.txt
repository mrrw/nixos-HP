######     Morning is the time to focus on gentle growth and self-maintenance;
######       I recommend some Yoga and Meditation before serving yourself a hot meal!
###    
######          Not every morning goes as planned, but that's ok.    
######             I hope that you find this imformation useful.

###     YESTERDAY:  Good day except it wasn't; I was in La-La-Land at work, and it was very unpleasant.  Could've gone worse, but it was pretty bad.
###                 
###     
###     TODAY    :  Today is boring.  I can't win.  On the other hand, I have done yoga and I've meditated, and am now enjoying a hot meal.
###                 My meditation was boring; yesterday, I really connected with Earth and Spirit (la-la).  Today?  Nothing.

######  TOMMOROW :  Thursday, back to Meadville.  Smoke has been a motivator for getting up early; what will motivate me now?
######              

###     PILE OF GOALS:  Actually work on some fucking music.
###                     
###       WORK ON MUSIC:  5:30am is not early enough.  If I want music, I have to be up by 4am, which means going to bed earlier (not possible?)
