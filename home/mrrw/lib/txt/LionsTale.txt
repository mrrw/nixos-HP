I've been the defender
	within the palace walls
	but I left that forever
	dead paladin
Now I'm scraping with pot shards
	I flinch when the boils burst 
		but I keep the tears from my eyes.

Now I'm looking to strangers
	to find more family
	but I'm only passing through
		just like a ghost
The home I'd return to
	would never let me in now
		for the muck of the pig-sty
			is in my skin.

	Guess I gotta move myself,
		there's nobody else.
		'cause I can't call for help
	When will I figure this out
		get past myself
		There's fighting outside
		and I'm just sitting on the shelf.









I awoke in the sickness
	that kept us all inside
	and I found a love within
		my heart of hearts
She and I rose up together,
	but Jesus, were you there cause,
		we did things you might not like.
Now we're still speaking Your names,
	but You will never hear us shout.
	'cause the voices in our head are
		are all our own
we grew up like this together
	but never would I help her
		to think to be disowned
			is worse than to disown

		And I never meant to leave behind,
			all the friends I left behind
		When we said good-bye to all the world
			to dive into our soul
	



		








I searched for a lover,
	but could not love myself,
	I'da stayed there forever,
	but the walls blew out.
I scanned for my savior,
	and I thought I saw a lion's tail
	just round the corner
		
	When will I pick myself up,
		and ready my staff,
		kick off the dust
	Why can't I move myself
		or cry out for help
		the lion is gone
		and there's nobody else
	I guess I gotta move myself	
		Run away from hell
		But I must confess
		I rather sit here 

But waiting for a savior
	still don't feel right
