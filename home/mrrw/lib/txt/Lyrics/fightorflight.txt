easy to feel
slow to heal
hard to obtain
fast to remain upon the shelf
{interlude}

you don't have to fight
though you have the right
you do have to fall
after it all
at least one time

the higher we climb, (shear wind force)

The farther we fall, yet we keep on climbing
Upon the world have-raped and crying
How much can we take, before we all stop trying
we're all just living and we'll all be dying

Trying to escape this nightmare ride
I promise I won't judge you if you just run and hide
but if you could muster, stick around and fight,
after all, this is our only life
and I'm deathly of heights
cause we all gotta fall























we're dogs and cats and lambs and lions

try to escape the nightmare ride
don't hesitate to run and hide
but don't be afraid to stand and fight
don't forget:  this is your only life

easy to feel
slow to heal
hard to obtain
fast to remain
big underway
fornificate
try to abstain

try not to be late for the fight
and show up with gloves
and don't them break you on the rocks
big underway
try to abstain
been left for dead
