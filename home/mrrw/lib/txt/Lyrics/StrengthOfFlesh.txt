    Tryna hold on
        to something that is not (such as)
        A goal to reach for
        A love that never was
        and never will be
    better let it go
        The strength of the flesh grows
faster than you know.
        Kinda like love,
        'xcept love is not obsession
        that keeps you tied up
        it's more than just reaction
        to the stuff in your heart
Heart in the past
darkning looking glass
Head in the sky
flying too high
           Pack one bag, then step outside
    no such thing as "a perfect life,"
                               alright?  So don't want it.
             in every moment that we cling
    grows the root of suffering
            as it trips, we curse our life
 coulda had it all if something had been different, but it
      wasn't, and now we're each stuck inside our own head
        When we attach to the ashes
        that we interact with
(ona daily basis)
        it's the one time
        that we sin against ourselves
(dark like the looking glass)
        (if love &) lust is just attraction
        manifesting action
        then we commit adultery
        with ourselves against ourselves and each other.
Heart in the past
darkning looking glass
Head in the sky
flying too high
    Pack one bag, then step outside
            ground above below the sky
            instead of trying to hold on

{solo}

pack up a bag, step into the woods
take a breath and look around
now just let the rest go
and never come back
The future you is real
the future you might be real
pack one bag, step outside
