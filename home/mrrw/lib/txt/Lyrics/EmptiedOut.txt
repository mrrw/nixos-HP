  6,4,2,3
another night of tossing fits
I sleep like shit, and though
the morning brings cold relief
I get no reprieve
thick, numb tongue running under unbrushed teeth
my bowels groaning as I breathe
with a rattle
(well I'm)
        looking for a cure,
        that I'll keep down, but I
        always get emptied out

Waiting through the night with satan at my bedside
Can't say I always try
to ignore his sickly-sweet lies
I'll put on my nothing face
the pace at which I breathe must be even
if I can keep breathing

        looking for a cure,
        that I'll keep down, but I
        always get emptied out



























another night where every hour
from the ache inside my soul
my very bones crack under the load
when will this feeling go
If I could make this the last night,
I'll give it all I got


with every single breath


another night
another toss another turn
breath in and out and think of nothing


requires self-control beyond what I have mastered
another disaster

I'll put a nothing face on
future wife
curves and healing powers
thank you for pretending to be
your service is appreciated

a cuddle will soothe my nerves
and put me back to right


another night of caughing fits
    the sleep I get is shit, so tired of it
        look for a cure,
        that I can keep down, but I get

emptied out

        mind is gears grinding,
        fear is finding me
alone
    in the middle of the night
    alone
prayers don't seem to move the sun any faster
