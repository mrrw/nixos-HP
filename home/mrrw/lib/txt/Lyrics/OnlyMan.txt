*If i'm the last person on earth
*what am I worth
*what is worth?

society would just be me,
My ownly friend,
my enemy.

{Em}and what would happen if I {G}die?
who would {D}care? I wouldn't {C}care
tragic thoughts invade my {Em}mind
only while it's {D}there.{D7}

    We're talking {G}feelings,
    {C}share 'em if you {G}got 'em
    {C}don't stop prete{G}nding other {C}people matter
    {A7min}even if they {D7}don't
    bring you fe{G}elings {C}that you wanna {E}feel
    it's a {Am}raw deal,
    but we {D}do what we gotta do

1 and 1 is 2,
share with me,
I'll share with you

1 and 1 and 1 is 3
The less for you,
the more for me

As if one human ain't enough
we've got the world, a whole damn world
and we are made of fragile stuff
every boy and girl

    (we're talking) fe{1}elings,
    share 'em while you got 'em
    don't stop pretending other people matter
    even if they {Am}don't:
        think the same as me
        or something that rhymes well with appear
        {Am}where there's two or {D}more
        the {G}differences {run}start to {Em}appear
        {Am}If we can work em {D}out

        I promise to treat myself right
        and not keep myself up in the night
        arguing about what's wrong and right,
        cause no-one really cares
        when nothing is that black and white

        and when two or more gather here
        then problems would surely appear
        and if twho or more gather here
        the problems begin to appear
        Lets stop it before it begins

        and when two or more gather here,
        the problems begin to appear
        at the same time that joy ushers in
        cause people are my home

        But then I open my eyes,
        but then when I come back to earth
        and
        I'm trying hard to understand
        why we matter at all,
        and how

        and when two or more gather here,
        the differences start to appear
        we work em out if we can



and if I sat down with myslef,
would I lie and say I mattered,
or would I just breathe?
something is something when it is preceived.


And if just lay down and take a little szooze,

who would win and who would lose?
or would I simply lose?

now say we add another man
I didn't plan,
so we'll just call him 'Stan.'

Stan plans much better than me,
but he's got no soul,
cause he's an engineer

Stan hates that I get weepy,
I hate that he's so cold
I guess we're married by default,
but I wouldn't wanna grow old with him
Stan builds robots

Stan builds robots with his time,
while I rock back and forth
I'll give a hand from time to time,
