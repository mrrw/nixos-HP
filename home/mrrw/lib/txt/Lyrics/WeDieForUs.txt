There's nothing I can say
To change the way the day
    challenges the frame of our marriage certificate
It isn't a huge deal yet,
    but in the future, mind yer step
    I can't forget to keep you in the loop

        I die for you
        Everytime I appologize
        I die before, I'll die again
        I'm guilty of sin
        I've gotta die, I've gotta give myself away
        I'm gonna die for real someday
        might as well do it now (meh)

There's thorn's and slugs and snakes
We can work our way through
    If we go real slow we can have a good time of it

        You die for me
        Every time you gotta catch up
        You die'd before, you'll die again
        I'm guilty of sin
        I've gotta die, I've gotta give myself away,
        There's nothing I could ask of you to change
            So I'll change what I can

            Atlas shrugged, and you fell off
                the face of the world
            Live with me and you get
                treated like a piece of furniture
            Try to keep up but everyday brings
                confusing changes
            Fire-flies light in the dark,
                everythings shuffles around, I...
