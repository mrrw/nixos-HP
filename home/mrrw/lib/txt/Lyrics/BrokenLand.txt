harvest is coming
wheat-head's white
turn the stubble under after,
keep next year in sight

bread grows scarce
find pure water
while you still can
nothing darker
than New Years Day

in nuclear winter

Frozen land, it's gonna be alright
the sun expands long after life

mother earth,
bitter after giving birth
flood and fire and famine
mother's son
goes out with a whimper
long before that bang

Broken land, it's gonna be alright
the sun expands long after life
don't be sad about it ending
live laugh love and die



"Frozen Land"

G, Cm, G#flat5th

Live laugh love
New years comin
relustions
visit your cousin
play out more
in the big backyard
don't do drugs
that's an easy one

What the hell
was that sound?
neighbors ducking
in the bunker underground
Maybe Russia,
Maybe France,
doesn't matter who did what in a frozen land

food is found
in the city
all the deer
have gone missing
eat your dog
eat your cousin
just move on
don't think nothin of it

Soddom and Gomorah didn't have it this bad
God-damn liberals brought the country low,
forget that it's a global problem, just know

Frozen land, you thought gamorah had it bad?
have fun prepping, I'll go out with the flash
I don't believe this fun is gonna last
He'll come on mushroom clouds,
The final trumbet blast

























beholden to delicate expectations
gotta hold the hand
can't run too fast
It's torture watching you play this game

I have nothing left to process.
I've dropped it all
