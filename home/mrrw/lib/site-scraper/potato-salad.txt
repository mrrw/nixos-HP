Our easy Potato Salad recipe is creamy, delicious, and the best side dish at any BBQ! I
make it with Yukon Gold Potatoes, hard boiled eggs, pickles, celery, and a creamy homemade
dressing.

Want more side dishes? I love this Corn Salad, Cucumber Salad, Baked Beans, and Street Corn
Pasta Salad.

is the Real Star of the BBQ

There are so many reasons to love a good ol’ classic potato salad, and our recipe has the
yummiest sauce, and flavor combo, making it deserving of its position as a summer BBQ
staple. (It’s always so hard to choose between this traditional potato salad recipe, and
our baked potato salad recipe. They are different, and both fantastic!) I love that I can
potato salad ahead of time and keep it in the fridge until ready to serve.

How to make Potato Salad:

Boil Potatoes: Place whole, unpeeled potatoes in a large pot of water. When it comes to a
boil, lower heat and simmer for 10-15 minutes, until potatoes are fork tender. Drain water
from pot, leaving potatoes inside, then cover with a lid so they can steam for 5-10 more
minutes. Peel potatoes, if desired, then cut into 1-inch chunks.

Make Potato Salad Dressing: Combine egg yolks, mayonnaise, buttermilk, mustard, a splash of
pickle juice, and salt and pepper in a bowl.

Instructions
 

  • Boil and Chop Potatoes: Place the whole, unpeeled potatoes in a large pot of water.
    Bring the water to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes, until
    the potatoes are fork tender. Drain the water completely from the pot and then cover
    the pot with a lid to allow the potatoes to steam for 5-10 minutes. Peel potatoes, if
    desired, and cut them into ½ inch chunks.
  • Make Dressing: Separate egg yolks from the whites of the hard boiled eggs and place
    the yolks in a bowl. Mash the yolks with a fork and then stir in the mayonnaise,
    buttermilk, mustard, a splash of pickle juice, and salt and pepper, to taste.
  • Assemble: Pour the dressing over the warm potatoes. Chop the egg whites and add them to
    the potatoes along with the celery, onion, and pickles. Stir well, cover, and
    refrigerate for a few hours to allow the flavors to blend.

Notes

Make Ahead Instructions: potato salad can be made 1-2 days ahead of time. It tastes best if
refrigerated for at least a few hours before serving. Store leftover potato salad in the
fridge for up to 5 days.

This is what potato salad is supposed to taste like! Took a little longer to prepare than
what it says here, but well worth it. I used my home-made dill pickle relish in place of
the dill pickles called for in this recipe (the garlic in the relish really worked well),
but otherwise followed the recipe pretty exactly. Be sure to cook the potatoes for the
recommended time and don’t leave them to steam too long or you’ll end up with mush.

This recipe has become one of my two go-to recipes for potato salad. The other recipe is an
absolutely different style so I can’t rate one over the other, but this one is absolutely
outstanding. My family loves it, my friends love it, and you can adjust the amounts of the
add ins (we love a little more red onion) and add your own flair if you so choose, although
it really is perfect exactly as written.

I made this for my partner’s birthday party and for me there was way too much dressing. I
even held back 1/2 cup of the mixture and wish I had reserved more because it felt like it
was drowning in mayo. I ended up doing 1.5 x the recommended pickles and adding an
additional 1 TBSP of mustard because it just tasted like mayo up until then. With the
tweaks it was still very wet, still a lot of dressing, but it tasted like more than mayo
and people seemed to enjoy it.

This the first time I followed a recipe for potato salad. I usually just make it from how
my Mom made it, a little of this and that. Well I have to say the this recipe was really
good. I will use this recipe again when making potato salad.

Just finished making and the test taste bite was delicious! Can’t wait to serve it after it
marinates all night. Thanks for a great recipe!

Hi Lauren, thank you for your recipe. Could you advise on how many dill pickle spears to
use? Or suggest a measured amount of cut up pickles? I understand 4 spears make a whole
pickle, but that would have yielded about a cup, and that seems like too much.?

Hi there! Thanks for reaching out. For this recipe, I’d recommend using about 2 to 3 dill
pickle spears, which should yield around 1/4 to 1/3 cup when finely chopped. You can always
start with that and adjust to taste. Hope that helps, and enjoy your potato salad! 😊

Made this for potluck and it seemed to be a hit! I’ve never made potato salad from scratch
and was pleased with the result. I used russet potatoes. No issues with that. Peel and dice
them into 1/2 inch chunks, add salt to the water, and cook for 10-13 mins once they reach a
boiling point. Keep checking because russets will fall apart if overcooked. My only
feedback is, please post dill pickle amount in tbsp/cups. I used spears but they seemed
quite large..I used 4 spears, not sure if that was too much. Whole pickles greatly vary in
size. If anyone can comment and share their measured amount, that would be very helpful.
Thank you.

First time I tried this recipe for a summer BBQ and it was delicious. It’s now a
fan-favorite. Thanks for the recipe. (I bet it’d be delicious with bacon too — everything
is better with bacon.)
