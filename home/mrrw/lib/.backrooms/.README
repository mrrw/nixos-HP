                                The Backrooms
    Based on     4chan creepypasta
   Adapted by    Backrooms (web series), internet users
     Genre       Analog horror, creepypasta
      Type       Alternate dimension, liminal space

The Backrooms are a fictional location originating from a 2019 4chan thread. One of
the best known examples of the liminal space aesthetic, the Backrooms are usually
portrayed as an impossibly large extradimensional expanse of empty rooms, accessed
by exiting ("no-clipping out of") reality.

Internet users have expanded on the concept of the Backrooms, introducing concepts
such as "levels" and hostile creatures that inhabit the space. In early 2022,
American YouTuber Kane Parsons started a series of Backrooms short films on YouTube,
which went viral. The videos have been credited with igniting a surge in Backrooms
content and taking the concept into the mainstream. Parsons is slated to direct a
film adaptation of his series produced by A24.

History

Original creepypasta

Between 2011 and 2018, a photograph of a large, carpeted room with fluorescent
lights and dividing walls circulated on various message boards, and on May 12, 2019,
an anonymous user started a thread on /x/, 4chan's paranormal-themed board, asking
users to "post disquieting images that just feel 'off,'" accompanying the thread
with the photograph.^[1]^[2]^[3]

Another user replied to this post, giving the image its name and supplying the first
description of the Backrooms:

    If you're not careful and you noclip out of reality in the wrong areas, you'll
    end up in the Backrooms, where it's nothing but the stink of old moist carpet,
    the madness of mono-yellow, the endless background noise of fluorescent lights
    at maximum hum-buzz, and approximately six hundred million square miles of
    randomly segmented empty rooms to be trapped in
    God save you if you hear something wandering around nearby, because it sure as
    hell has heard you

— Anonymous, 4chan (May 13, 2019)^[1]

Growth and fandom

Days after the original creepypasta,^[4] users began to share stories about the
Backrooms on subreddits such as r/creepypasta and later r/backrooms.^[2] A fandom
began to develop around the Backrooms and creators expanded upon the original
iteration of the creepypasta by creating additional floors or "levels" and entities
which populate them.^[3]^[5] Two notable levels include: Level 1, a level with
industrial architecture, and Level 2, a darkly lit level with long service tunnels,
with the original version named Level 0.^[5]

As new levels were devised in r/backrooms, a faction of fans who preferred the
original Backrooms split off from the fandom. A Reddit user named Litbeep created
another subreddit called r/TrueBackrooms focusing only on the original version. ABC
News said that unlike fandoms surrounding existing properties, the lack of a
canonical Backrooms made "drawing a line between authentic storytelling and jokes"
difficult.^[2]^[3] By March 2022, r/backrooms had over 157,000 members.^[2]

The fandom steadily expanded onto other platforms with the upload of videos on
Twitter and TikTok.^[4] Various wikis hosted on FANDOM and Wikidot dedicated to the
lore and worldbuilding of The Backrooms were established.^[6] Dan Erickson, creator
of the television series Severance (2022), named the Backrooms as one of his many
influences while working on the series.^[7]

Image origin

Until 2024, the source of the original Backrooms image was not widely known.^[3]^[8]
^[9] In May 2024, a Twitter user announced in a now-viral post that their friend had
discovered the image's origin.^[8]^[9] This was the result of a combined effort in a
Backrooms-dedicated Discord community,^[10] which traced the image to an archived
webpage from March 2003 using the Wayback Machine.^[11]

The image was found to have been taken during the renovation of "a former furniture
store with plenty of partitions and fake inner walls" in Wisconsin.^[12]^[13] For
much of the 20th century, Rohner's Home Furnishings occupied 807 and 811 Oregon
Street, Oshkosh, Wisconsin.^[14] In 2003, 807 Oregon Street was acquired by a new
tenant, a branch of the American hobby shop chain HobbyTown.^[9]^[10]^[15]

Sometime in 2002, the second story underwent renovations. On June 12, 2002, the
progress was photographed with a Sony Cyber-shot camera, and on March 2, 2003, the
various interior views were documented on the Oshkosh branch's renovation weblog.^[9
] One photograph depicts a carpeted, open room with yellow wallpaper and fluorescent
lighting on a Dutch angle. Uploaded with the file name "Dsc00161.jpg"; this is the
image that would go on to inspire the concept of the Backrooms.^[8]^[9]^[13] The
image was captioned as an original view of "the East (Oval) room", and noted that no
windows were visible. The blog entry described extensive water damage that required
the area to be cleared.^[13]^[10] HobbyTown has since converted the facility into a
radio-controlled car racing track called Revolution Racing, and the room's original
layout is now gone.^[8]^[13]^[10]

Reception

An example of a liminal space. This is an image of a long, empty hallway.
The Backrooms have been associated with an internet aesthetic known as liminal
spaces, which include "images of eerie and uninhabited spaces", such as the above
empty hallway.^[16]

Some sources believe the Backrooms to have been the origin of the internet aesthetic
of liminal spaces,^[4] which depict usually busy locations as unnaturally empty. The
#liminalspaces hashtag has amassed nearly 100 million views on TikTok.^[16]^[17]
Paste's Phoenix Simms wrote that the Backrooms and games such as the more absurdist
The Stanley Parable is "tied to a long tradition of the liminal in horror" and the
color yellow as a symbol of caution, deterioration, and existential distress. The
Backrooms' is "a fungal, sickly yellow", where both the person and the mind can lose
themselves.^[18]

PC Gamer compared the Backrooms' various levels to H. P. Lovecraft's R'lyeh and The
City in the manga Blame!, describing it as "an uncanny valley of place".^[19] ABC
News and Le Monde grouped the Backrooms into an "emerging genre of collaborative
online horror" which also includes the SCP Foundation.^[3]^[6] Kotaku said that this
collaborative aspect, as well as the lack of overt horror or threat, made the
Backrooms stand out from other creepypastas.^[4] Both Kotaku and Tama Leaver,
professor of internet studies at Curtin University, felt that the Backrooms was
scary "because [it invites] you to interpret what's not shown". While Leaver
believed that the "eerie feeling of familiarity" helped draw fans together, Kotaku
said that the horror was in part derived from the subtle "wrongness" present in
liminal spaces.^[2]^[4]

In 2022, there was a TikTok trend for videos that zoomed in on Google Earth to
reveal an entrance to the Backrooms.^[19]^[20]

Adaptations

YouTube

Main article: Backrooms (web series)

In January 2022, a short horror film titled "The Backrooms (Found Footage)" was
uploaded to YouTube. Created by then-16-year-old Kane Parsons of Northern California
, known online as Kane Pixels, it is presented as a VHS tape recorded by a filmmaker
who accidentally enters the Backrooms in the 1990s and is pursued by a monster.^[21]
^[22] Parsons used the software Blender and Adobe After Effects to create the
environment of the Backrooms, and it took him a month to complete it. He described
the Backrooms as a manifestation of a poorly remembered recollection of the late 90s
and early 2000s.^[2]^[3] The video has over 68 million views as of October 2025^
[update].^[23]^[24]

The short was praised by the fandom^[23] and received positive reviews from critics.
WPST called it "the scariest video on the Internet".^[25] Otaku USA categorized it
as analog horror,^[26] while Dread Central and Nerdist compared it favorably to the
2019 video game Control.^[27]^[28] Kotaku praised the series for exercising
restraint in its horror and mystery.^[4] Boing Boing's Rob Beschizza predicted that
the Backrooms, like the creepypasta Slender Man and its panned 2018 film adaptation,
would eventually be adapted into a "slick but dismal 2-hour Hollywood movie."^[29]

Expanding his videos into a series of short films,^[30] Parsons introduced plot
aspects such as Async, an organization which opened a portal into the Backrooms in
the 1980s and conducted research within it.^[3]^[4] The series has collectively
garnered over 197 million views.^[31] It is also credited with lifting the Backrooms
from obscurity into the mainstream internet and causing a surge in Backrooms
content,^[4]^[19] particularly on YouTube.^[32] For his shorts, Parsons received a
Creator Honors at the 2022 Streamy Awards from The Game Theorists.^[33]

Film adaptation

Main article: The Backrooms (film)

On February 6, 2023, A24 announced that they are working on a film adaptation of the
Backrooms based on Parsons' videos, with Parsons directing. Roberto Patino is set to
write the screenplay, while James Wan, Michael Clear from Atomic Monster, Shawn Levy
, Dan Cohen, and Dan Levine of 21 Laps are set to produce.^[21]^[30]

American Horror Stories

An episode inspired by the Backrooms was included in the third season of American
Horror Stories, a direct spin-off to American Horror Story.^[34]^[35]^[36] The
episode stars Michael Imperioli as a grief-stricken screenwriter who falls in and
out of the "Backrooms", mundane locations where he is confronted by a manifestation
of his missing son.^[37] The episode was one in a group of five to be released as a
"Huluween event".^[38]

Video games

The Backrooms have been adapted into numerous video games, including on the
platforms Steam and Roblox.^[19]^[23]^[39] An indie game was released by Pie on a
Plate Productions two months after the original creepypasta,^[40] and was positively
reviewed for its atmosphere but received criticism for its short length.^[41]^[42]^[
43] Many others, such as Enter the Backrooms, Noclipped and The Backrooms Project,
were released in the following years.^[39] Co-op multiplayer Escape the Backrooms by
Fancy Games was praised by Bloody Disgusting for its depiction of the extended lore,
^[30]^[44] while The Backrooms 1998 (both 2022), a psychological survival horror
game independently released by one-person developer Steelkrill Studio, was noted by
reviewers for its found footage visuals and limited save system.^[45]^[46] Dreamcore
, a 2025 first-person psychological horror video game developed by Argentinian
studio Montraluz takes inspiration from the Backrooms.^[47]
