Saving Cabbage Seeds: A Complete Guide for Self-Sufficient Gardeners

Saving cabbage seeds is a rewarding practice for gardeners who enjoy self-sufficient gardening and wish to preserve their favorite cabbage
varieties. By saving seeds, you not only reduce your dependence on store-bought seeds but also help cultivate plants that are better
adapted to your local growing conditions. This guide will walk you through the process of saving cabbage seeds, from understanding the
plant’s lifecycle to harvesting and storing the seeds.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Understanding Cabbage as a Biennial

Cabbage (Brassica oleracea) is a biennial plant, meaning it takes two growing seasons to complete its lifecycle. In the first year,
cabbage grows leaves and forms a head, which is typically harvested for consumption. In the second year, if allowed to grow, the plant
produces flowers and seeds. For saving cabbage seeds, you’ll need to let the plant overwinter and reach the second stage of its lifecycle.

Importance of Pollination in Cabbage Seed Production

Cabbage is pollinated by insects, making it essential to consider cross-pollination when saving seeds. Cabbage can cross with other
members of the Brassica oleracea family, such as broccoli, kale, and cauliflower. To maintain pure cabbage seeds, you must isolate the
plants from other Brassica species either by distance or by using physical barriers like row covers.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Step 1: Selecting Cabbage Plants for Seed Saving

The first step in saving cabbage seeds is selecting the plants you want to propagate. This process, known as “roguing,” involves
identifying the healthiest and most desirable plants. Look for traits such as:

  • Disease resistance: Choose plants that have shown resilience to common cabbage diseases.
  • Head formation: Select plants with well-formed, dense heads.
  • Flavor: Ensure the cabbage has a flavor you enjoy.
  • Vigor: Pick plants that grow robustly in your specific climate.

Mark these plants during the growing season so you can easily identify them when it’s time to let them overwinter.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Step 2: Overwintering Cabbage Plants

Cabbage plants must survive the winter to produce seeds the following year. There are two primary methods for overwintering:

1. In-Ground Overwintering

If you live in an area with mild winters, you can leave the cabbage plants in the ground. Mulch heavily around the base of the plants to
protect them from frost and extreme temperature fluctuations.

2. Root Cellar or Indoor Overwintering

In colder climates, dig up the cabbage plants before the first hard frost. Trim the outer leaves but leave the central head intact. Store
the plants in a cool, dark, and humid location, such as a root cellar. Replant them in the garden in early spring when the weather warms.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Step 3: Encouraging Flowering and Seed Production

When spring arrives, cabbage plants will focus their energy on producing flowers instead of leaves. These flowers are small and yellow,
forming clusters at the top of tall stalks. Ensure that the plants have sufficient space to grow, as they can become quite large during
this stage.

During flowering, insects like bees and butterflies will pollinate the plants. If you are isolating cabbage from other Brassicas to
maintain seed purity, ensure that barriers or distance measures remain effective.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Step 4: Harvesting Cabbage Seeds

Once pollination occurs, the flowers will develop into seed pods, known as siliques. These pods start green and mature to a tan or brown
color. Here’s how to harvest the seeds:

 1. Timing: Wait until most of the seed pods have turned brown but harvest before they start to split open. This prevents seed loss.
 2. Cutting Stalks: Use sharp garden shears to cut the seed stalks from the plant.
 3. Drying: Bundle the stalks together and hang them upside down in a well-ventilated, dry area to complete the drying process.
 4. Threshing: Once the pods are fully dry, place them in a bag or on a clean surface and gently crush them to release the seeds.
 5. Cleaning: Separate the seeds from the chaff using a sieve or by winnowing (blowing gently to remove lightweight debris).

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Step 5: Storing Cabbage Seeds

Proper storage is critical to maintaining the viability of your saved cabbage seeds. Follow these guidelines:

  • Dry the Seeds Completely: Ensure the seeds are thoroughly dry before storage. Any residual moisture can lead to mold or reduced
    viability.
  • Choose an Airtight Container: Store the seeds in a sealed container, such as a glass jar with a tight-fitting lid or a resealable
    plastic bag.
  • Label the Container: Include the variety name and the date of harvest on the container to keep track of your seed collection.
  • Store in a Cool, Dark Place: Seeds last longer when stored in a cool, dark, and dry environment. A refrigerator or dedicated seed
    storage box is ideal.

Cabbage seeds can remain viable for up to five years if stored properly.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Tips for Successful Cabbage Seed Saving

 1. Avoid Hybrid Varieties: If you’re saving seeds for the first time, start with open-pollinated or heirloom varieties. Seeds saved from
    hybrid plants may not produce true-to-type offspring.
 2. Prevent Cross-Pollination: If you grow multiple Brassica species, consider timing their flowering periods to avoid overlap or use
    isolation methods.
 3. Save Enough Plants: To maintain genetic diversity, save seeds from at least 5-10 plants. This ensures a healthy and robust seed stock.
 4. Observe for Pests and Diseases: Monitor the plants during the seed production stage and address any pest or disease issues promptly.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Benefits of Saving Cabbage Seeds

Saving cabbage seeds offers numerous benefits, including:

  • Cost-Effectiveness: Reduces the need to purchase seeds each year.
  • Adaptation: Allows plants to acclimate to your local soil, climate, and growing conditions over time.
  • Preservation of Rare Varieties: Helps preserve heirloom or rare cabbage varieties for future generations.
  • Self-Sufficiency: Supports a self-reliant gardening lifestyle.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Troubleshooting Common Challenges

While saving cabbage seeds is straightforward, you may encounter a few challenges. Here’s how to address them:

  • Premature Pod Splitting: If seed pods begin to split prematurely, harvest them earlier and dry them indoors.
  • Cross-Pollination: If unexpected traits appear in your next cabbage crop, it may indicate cross-pollination. Improve isolation
    techniques in the future.
  • Low Seed Viability: If stored seeds fail to germinate well, check storage conditions and ensure proper drying.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Conclusion

Saving cabbage seeds is a fulfilling practice that deepens your connection to gardening and fosters self-sufficiency. By understanding the
cabbage lifecycle, selecting the best plants, and following proper harvesting and storage methods, you can enjoy a reliable supply of
high-quality seeds for years to come. Whether you’re preserving a beloved variety or experimenting with new ones, the process of saving
cabbage seeds is a valuable skill for any gardener. Start saving your cabbage seeds today, and experience the joy of cultivating a truly
homegrown crop!

Larrn

I ordered seeds by mail and received them in 3 days. I was impressed by the prompt service and I’m excited to see how the seeds do! I also
received a couple “freebies” with my order which is always fun. Will most likely be ordering seeds from this company again as I have
started ordering heirloom and/or open-pollinated seeds and I feel this company’s values mirror my own.

French Breakfast Radishes

It is March 25 and I just harvested a dozen perfect French Breakfast radishes!! What a tender and mild radish and delightful in appearance
with slender white bottoms and light red tops. They even stayed healthy through our recent severe 28 degree freezes, although I did cover
them with a light blanket each night out of an abundance of caution as the greens were so healthy prior to the freezing nights. Definitely
ordering this sweet radish variety again! Many thanks, St Claire Seed family!

David M.

Mike and Kelly

Thanks

Whoa, that was fast, got the seeds in just a few days and packed very well. This one is a gift, but will order more when funds come in. I
was very happy at the variety and amount. Thank you so much.

Deborah Theroux

Zinnias

I am so impressed with the Zinnia seeds I purchased. This year, 2023, has been very hot and our area has suffered from extreme drought.
The zinnia seeds I started last winter have been blooming all summer, and are still doing very well. Because of our wildlife on our
property, they are growing in pots to protect them from being dug up by armadillos. With a hand watering the have held up to this year’s
summer. Thank you St. Clare’s Seeds!!!

Joan Dietrich

Happy I found them!

I love their seeds and these wonderful folks are such a joy to do business with. I plan to order again and again, if God’s willing.

James

Gardenman

St Claire is my favorite seed shopping destination!!! Will continue to shop here!!!

mike kolchins

fast shipping

Satisfied as always, ordered 3 days ago and received my seeds today. Last year germination was close to 95%. I really like the religious
theme even though I am not Catholic.

Ruth Engelthaler

Great Micro-Greens

Love how quickly my seeds germinated. I love the nutrition and ease of growing microgreens.

Genessa

Excellent seed company!

I have placed a few orders with St. Clare Heirloom Seeds, and I have been very happy every single time! I have ordered multiple varieties
of vegetables and herbs for planting in all seasons (I’m in zone 8b, so I can basically garden year-round), and all germination rates have
been super. Resulting produce is outstanding in taste and appearance. Prices are very good, and packaging is appreciated. I love that the
inner bags are resealable! I plan to purchase regularly!

Fr. J

Trustworthy

Great seeds from a company that has the courage to operate with Christian values.

michael kolchins

fast shipping

I ordered my seeds two days ago and got them this morning. Cannot attest to the seeds as they are for next year. Appreciated the
Information page , learned a lot, even though I was a farmer and gardener for 50+ years.

Linda Woody

Excellent Seeds, Service, and Shipping

My order of vegetable seeds came today and I am thrilled. I have purchased and grown vegetable seeds from St. Clare Seeds before and they
grew very well even in our Mojave Desert climate Zone 8b. I am impressed with the service from St. Clare Seeds. High integrity, quick
shipping and they do as they promise. Quality company all the way. I recommend purchasing seeds from St. Clare Seed Company whenever you
need new seeds.

Al Talley

Impressed with St. Clare’s products

I have been dealing with St, Clare’s seed for four years now. I am quite impressed with the quality, selection and well written articles
about each produce. The packages are reasonably price and the delivery is prompt. I happened to stumble on this family business through a
traditional Catholic link. I am quite impressed with their beliefs in what they stand for; it is parallel to mine. Therefore, my dollars
are my voice for support of a moralistic enterprise.

Christie

Suprise squash

I ordered some yellow summer squash seeds and they turned out perfect, except for one plant. All of the fruit is half yellow and half
green. Not sure if it accidentally slipped in the packet but I absolutely love the flavor and would like to know if you have that variety
or if it was just a fluke. Nonetheless, I will never order from another seed company as I have been 100% pleased with all the seeds I’ve
ordered! Thank you for all of your hard work towards good quality!

Katherine

Happy with my order!

I ordered a few seed varieties to fill in gaps I had in the garden- peas, some flowers, etc. The order came quickly, and I’ve had great
germination on the things I’ve already planted. My kids were happy to take over the free peas in our order, and I was even more pleased
with the newsletter with tips and discount codes! So glad we decided to shop small this summer season!

Tom Postorino

Packaging

I really like your method of packaging. Keeping the little bag is very helpful. Thank you and Gods blessings

God Bless St. Clare seed company

St. Clare, I recently ordered seeds from you and I would like you to know how pleased I am. I am thrilled to find your seed company. You
had all the seeds I love to plant and especially the Kentucky Wonder Pole beans I have not been able to find with any other seed company.
I am so pleased to find an American Godly company whom I share the same beliefs with. Your prices are GREAT and I absolutely appreciate
this. I am a 79 y.o. retired nurse who loves gardening year-round, weather permitting. I was able to find all the seeds I needed that most
of the other seed companies stopped selling. I wanted American born seeds, not seeds that come from China or any other country. Thank you
very much for being here for me and God Bless your family, friends and business. May you prosper and grow for years to come. Thank you for
delivering my order so promptly and efficiently. I give you a ten, thumbs up for service, products and prices. God Bless You

Thank you!!

I received the tomato seeds I ordered very quickly, which is hugely appreciated! I was kept updated from when they left John & Sarah’s
shipping facility until when they were to be delivered. Great service!! And thanks much for the free packet of seeds!!n

Jennifer Voorhies

Exseeded my expectations (pun intended)

Every seed I’ve planted sprouts and produces! I no longer buy my seeds from anywhere else. My gardens are always very large typically
around 1.5+ acres. I’m glad I made the swap to Heirloom seeds from buying and planting hybrid seeds my past experience over half will not
even sprout. Also my bees are very happy with all the beautiful flowers right now providing nectar for their hive!

Phil

Thank you

Thank you for the great service! Also am blessed by your value on family, as well as providing quality seeds that are heirloom non GMOs
etc. God bless you

Marcia

Excellent quality and service so prompt I almost didn’t get my browser window closed before my seeds arrived. Well-vetted list of organic,
non-GMO seeds. I had my best crop of tomatoes ever from St. Clare’s heirloom mix.

Marinda

Great Selection & Service…

I was so pleased to find a company with seeds that are non-GMO and such a great variety. I also appreciate that they are an American
company. My package came fast and complete, I couldn’t be happier with my purchase. Thank You

Brenda

I ordered seeds at the beginning of the shut downs this year and they arrived pretty quick. All seeds came up and are growing beautifully.
Will be ordering from St. Claire from now on and recommending to everyone.

Mark

First time buyer

10.0 out of 10.0

This is the second season – for Spring 2021 – that I’ve bought seeds from St. Clare Seeds. As a business, their prices are excellent
vis-s-vis the “big seed companies”, service is prompt – delivery a few days after I placed my order and communication – confirmation &
shipping info – timely and accurate. Good service. But over and above good service, the seeds are top quality. The seeds germinate, plants
grow, flowers bloom abundantly. It doesn’t get any better than that.

Mike &amp

  My soon to be Wife and I would like to sincerely Thank You ( everyone involved ! ), for the prompt & very friendly service we received
from your fantastic company.n  I’m trying to get her into gardening and once we found your website and read through everything, we knew it
was the clear cut choice ( there were very many) to help get our first Family garden up and going…and have seeds for years to come.n  All
of the seeds look spectacular and there is plenty of excitement here to see the amazing plants they will becomen  We look very forward to
doing business with you again ! nn  May God’s Grace be with you everywhere you go and we wish you all very happy gardening ! nnMike &

Amazing Seeds

Just received my seeds, they arrived on time, and each packet provided instructions on planting and care which is incredible useful to us
beginners. There was also a sweet note and even a free packet of seeds!

Patrick

Excited to Start Planting

I ordered many seeds this year from St. Clare because they are Pro-family, Pro-God, Pro-America! I have been gardening for several years,
so to finally find a seed company that has very similar values is a huge blessing. I plan to continue to support St. Clare Seeds!

nebraska1

I have been a customer of St Clare for at least four years! They have been awesome and timely in response in correspondence.i have only
had one issue of germination of which they were totally responsive and resolved in a professional and more than positive response! Thank
you St Clare I feel confident every time I order that I will get good product, service and care!

Beverly

I am very pleased with how quickly I received my order. I will definitely order from here again. Anxious to plant them and start my
garden.

recommend and will be buying again!

I feel very blessed to have ordered seeds from St. Claire Seeds. Even with the pandemic going on, the neat seed packages with planting
info came in 10 days. Nice selection of seeds for our family!

we’ve been happy customers for 5 years. love telling our friends about St Clare’s and couldn’t be happier to support a Catholic family

Frank A. Davis

I believe in GOD, County, and Family (Which includes everyone.

I am 81 years old and old enough to remember how vegetables are supposed to taste. Heirloom and open pollinated seeds is what this country
was raised on and it should be today as well. I love purchasing seeds from St Clare Seeds and believe that a company that puts GOD first
above all things is the way to go. We also should all have a “Victory Garden” like I remember everyone had when I was a child. Don’t
depend on the grocery store for you food, grow it yourself, It tastes better and is better for you. Live long and prosper St Clare and
keep up the great work. GOD knew what he was doing when he first made the seeds. We should not assume the we know better than him. Do not
change what he created. Go heirloom and open pollinated seeds and buy them from St Clare Seeds.

Karen

Really good quality seeds

Greatly please with the seeds , fast shipping too .

Kris

My new favorite seed sellers!!! We purchased seed from St. Clare’s last year. I had the biggest, most beautiful marigolds ever! We were
pleased with all of the seed that we purchased. The order arrived very quickly and everything we planted grew well. We highly recommend
them! Oh, and their customer service is outstanding, as we needed to add to one of our orders and it was no problem at all.

Scott and Cindy

Thank you St Clare Seeds. We received excellent service. Our seeds arrived on time. When we ordered on the internet my computer was not
working as well as St Clare Seeds computers. I pushed the submit button one to many times my charges was times three. I then wrote them
and email in which their reply was very prompt. They returned my money as they said they would. Thank you for being the most honest people
we have ever done business with.nScott and Cindy

Jane

This is the first time I have made a purchase from St. Clare Seeds based on their high ratings with the Garden Watchdog. The seeds I
ordered were received very promptly. I will make a purchase from them in the future.

Katie W

The Best!

Garden planning is fun for us as a family. I didn’t expect to receive my seeds so quickly! I’m definitely ordering more. We’re so happy to
support this family-run business.

C&amp

Just placed our first order

We’ve just placed our first order for St. Clare seeds and had a bit of trouble doing so. Online shopping is not the best option for these
old folks, so made a mistake in the order. We sent an email the next day, explaining the problem and got a prompt response with a
correction more generous than requested. And to our surprise the seeds were delivered a couple of days later, with a very kind note and
wishing us Blessings. It doesn’t get any better than that.nNow if we can do a better job at gardening than we did with ordering, we should
be enjoying a great harvest in the months ahead.nn

Recommended most definitely

A pleasure to do business with for my gardening needs. I’m grateful to support a company whose values are aligned with mine and who do
such a fabulous job. Thank you-I’ll always check St. Clare’s Seeds first for my gardening needs.

Marcia

I’d like to keep this secret to myself, but … St. Clare’s worm casts are miraculous. They work wonders, rejuvenating plants I thought
would never survive much less thrive. They’ve given my tired container gardens a new lease on life.

Lolly

I have yet to start germinating any of the seeds (they look to be of excellent quality) but I am so very satisfied already! I bought worm
castings (very good rich quality and organic) which have the shipping already worked into the cost and are shipped Priority Mail along
with 8 packets of seed. St.Clare’s Seeds added an additional pack of FREE Heirloom Tomatoes! Isn’t that nice? — Also, I ordered late in
the evening on 1/28 and received my order (both the castings and the seed) on 1/31. Amazingly quick turnaround! A good faith and family
oriented company. I will definitely continue to do business with them and will encourage my associates to do the same.

JMC

Quite a wonderful seed company! I purchased beet and radish seed from them and it all arrived quite quickly, with informative papers to
help you along with growing what you purchased. I even received a little bonus packet of seed and sample pack of earthworm castings! Will
definitely buy from them again!

Title of Testimonial Our friend

St. Clare Heirloom Seeds feels to us like a trusted friend. We held on to some of our seed for several years and were delighted that we
still had a very high germination rate. There is consolation in having top quality heirloom seed safely tucked away for times of
necessity. Thank you John and Sarah! Blessings galore to you.

Something To Eat Farm

The Best Seed Company I Know Of

As a full-time market farmer, this is the greatest small seed company I know of. I have ordered from about 35 companies over the past 5
years and St Clare is the Best. I prefer to order from 3 companies only now, due to the quality of non-gmo seeds, and St Clare is one of
them. St. Clair is my go to company for open pollinated seeds. I cannot tell you how many seed companies must be selling old seeds that
have poor germination. I feel I can truly trust St Clare Seeds, and they have been on the non-gmo campaign way longer than most companies.
Thanks for keeping God’s Command in doing the best you can in your line of work. Peace!!!

Matthew

Every seed we planted grew

I planted about half the seeds from the order below. I’m happy to report that every seed sprouted and grew, which surprised me. Thank you
for including the radish seeds as well. I gave them to a family member who has more garden space and they have been very happy with
them.nnTomato – Black KrimnTomato – Heirloom Rainbow BlendnTomato – Cherokee Purple

great seeds

I have been buying seeds from St clare’s for about 5 years. I found my popcorn seeds here, then started buying my other garden seeds here.
Very dependable, and seeds are great producers.

Great Seeds and Great Service

I love ordering from this wonderful company. Very fast service and my seeds germinate well. I found two varieties of white tomatoes here
that we absolutely love. Sweet and juice White Wonder and Great White are really delicious! We keep planting these year after year.
Heirloom tomatoes are just delicious! I can’t wait for next year’s growing season!

Excellent website with some neat hard to find items. Great selections. I ordered labels for my canning jars as well with my order. Haven’t
seen those offered on a site before! Seeds and items ordered came quickly and organized and packaged perfectly. Love ordering from
company’s like this. Glad I found them and will gladly use them for my next seed purchase. Highly recommend

Ruth

Love the service and the products

I have always received excellent, timely service from St. Clare Seeds. Love the family friendly, Christian vibes from this company!

Holli Ward

Exceeded expectations

I can’t not say enough positive things about my experience with St Clare Heirloom Seeds. My seeds arrived in a very timely manner, exactly
as ordered, with a hand signed note and extra growing tips and resources included. The seeds are packaged in clearly labeled, ziploc bags
within the envelopes to assure safe storage for unused seeds to be used the following year and the seeds are growing beautifully in our
home, getting ready to transfer outside when the weather permits. The quality and foundation of the company truly made me feel as though I
was a part of the family. We will be getting our seeds from St Clare’s every year!

Pat J

I just received my first order from St. Claire Seeds and was surprised how quickly the order came and with a free package of carrot seeds
as a gift! I am so happy to have discovered this company and, although it’s -24 degrees outside, it definitely put me in a springtime mood
to find my order in my mailbox.. I’ll definitely be back for more!

Willow

John & Sarah treated me like a friend. In placing an order for several families (to share shipping costs), I realized after the fact that
I’d missed a list. I emailed to ask if I could add the extra seeds, and they very graciously said I could either place a second order &
they’d refund the second shipping charge (sending all the seeds together), or I could send the list of seeds I’d missed & they’d redo the
order for me. They even offered to separate out the seeds from the different orders in the packaging! I placed a second order (to spare
them the trouble), and they did refund the extra shipping charge on the credit card. The seeds arrived quickly, in good condition, and in
generous amounts (I’m sharing the extras with other gardening friends). I loved doing business with them!

Banana Tree

I have purchased seeds from them for several years. Prompt and great service. Wonderful seeds that have resulted in a great harvest.

Vetrap

Love the selection, immediate service and commitment to ideals that reflect my own- please keep up the good work and may God Bless

Merrytyne

I ordered my vegetable garden seeds from St. Clare’s after seeing all of the positive reviews on GardenWatchdog. I was not disappointed!!
My seeds were shipped within a day and I received everything that had been ordered, they even included some free broccoli! There was also
a handwritten thank you note from John and Sarah, as well as some helpful materials about gardening in general. I loved that I was able to
order from a small family business and that everything was heirloom and non treated/GMO. I look forward to ordering from them again and
would highly recommend them.

Gardenlover

I was very impressed by the website. Ordered a number of seeds and received them and 1 free packet within a couple of days. Very impressed
can not wait to plant the seeds. Already have told others and they are going to order as well. Will definitely order from again.

lynn

Found this company while searching for GMO free seeds. Placed my order and received the seeds in two days!
