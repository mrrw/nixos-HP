Description

    Nodding onion is a North American native perennial bulb in the onion family
    (Amaryllidaceae) that is found in open woodlands and around shale outcrops in
    the low elevation mountains. This plant grows 1 to 2 feet tall with long
    grass-like foliage. The genus name comes from Latin meaning garlic and the
    species name means nodding. 

    Nodding onion prefers well-drained, humus-rich, alkaline or neutral soil in
    full sun. It is drought-tolerant once established and easy to grow. Nodding
    clusters of bell-shaped, pink or white flowers bloom in June to August and are
    attractive to pollinators and songbirds. It will spread by both bulb offsets
    and seeds but is easiest to propagate by dividing the bulblets. 

    All parts of the plant have an oniony smell. It was once used in cooking but it
    is mainly used for its flowers now. 

    It can be used in rock, culinary, cottage, butterfly, native or pollinator
    gardens. It may be mass planted or used in small groups within borders. It will
    also naturalize in a meadow or open woodland setting.
