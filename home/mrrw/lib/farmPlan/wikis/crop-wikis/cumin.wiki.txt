Key Points

  • Cumin plants thrive in USDA zones 5-10.
  • Plant cumin in well-draining soil with plenty of sunlight and maintain adequate
    watering without over-soaking.
  • Cumin seeds are typically harvested four to five months after planting and need
    to be completely dry before storage.

Cumin, known for its fragrant seeds, is a noteworthy addition to any culinary
garden. Used in diverse recipes such as Indian curries and meat rubs, cumin seeds
impart a rich, earthy flavor. Cultivating and harvesting cumin directly from your
garden ensures a fresh and aromatic spice experience. Thankfully, growing cumin
plants, or Cuminum cyminum, is relatively simple. We spoke with gardening experts
who share essential tips for planting, growing, and harvesting this useful spice.

How to Grow a Kitchen Garden That Fulfills All Your Culinary Needs

When to Plant Cumin

You will want to wait to plant cumin until after the danger of the last frost has
passed and when night temperatures are above 60 degrees Fahrenheit, says Brandi
Eide, senior director of facilities and strategic initiatives at San Diego Botanic
Garden. "Plants take around four months to harvest and need warm weather to
properly develop," she says, adding that if you’re growing cumin in a colder
climate, you may want to start seeds indoors to provide enough time to mature.

Sonya Query, master gardener and marketing director for Love, Plants, Inc., says
those indoor seeds should be started around four to six weeks before the last frost
date. "If starting indoors, make sure they get plenty of light (natural or a grow
light), and keep seeds constantly damp until germination," says Query.

How (and When) to Start Seeds Indoors to Prepare Them for Spring Planting

Where to Plant Cumin

Cumin does best in conditions that are similar to the regions it’s native to, like
the Mediterranean, says Query. That means that in the U.S., cumin does best in USDA
zones 5-10, she says.

When it comes to ensuring that your cumin will do well once it’s in the ground,
Brandi Eide, senior director of facilities and strategic initiatives at San Diego
Botanic Garden, says it’s all about giving it the best start, which includes
finding the perfect spot in your garden. 

"Plant in well-draining soil, with at least four to six hours of sun per day," she
says, adding that your plants will need adequate watering throughout the growing
season. "Soil can dry slightly between waterings, but do not let the soil stay wet
or completely dry out." Amendments like mulch or organic material will help with
retaining moisture. 

Find Your USDA Hardiness Zone

How to Plant Cumin

Germination takes around two weeks, according to Eide, who suggests soaking seeds
in water overnight before planting to speed up the process. "Plant directly in soil
when possible, or minimally disturb roots if transplanting," she says, adding that
you’ll want to sow your seeds shallowly (around 1/4 inch deep) and keep moist until
leaves develop. "Plant heavily to harvest enough seed to utilize in your kitchen."

As for spacing, Query says you’ll want to give them plenty of room to fill out.
"When planting, give each seed plenty of space to breathe—about 4 to 6 inches
apart," she says.

Cumin plants grow about one to two feet high, according to Eide, who says they can
look very similar to carrot tops or dill once they mature. 

Fertilizing

Fortunately, cumin isn’t a heavy feeder, so you won’t have to do too much in the
way of fertilizing. Eide says that while the plants appreciate "nutrient-rich
soil," supplemental fertilizer is generally not necessary.

When and How to Harvest Cumin

The seed is the portion used as a spice, according to Eide. "Small umbels of
flowers will form and once fertilized, seeds will develop," she says. "They will
swell and turn from green to yellow/tan and split easily when ripe."

The seed will be ready to harvest around four to five months after planting. "Cut
seed heads and place [them] in a paper bag to dry, clean, and harvest in one to two
weeks," Eide says. 

Since the seeds are where all the flavor is, Query has a great trick for ensuring
that you’re able to collect all of them. "Cut the stalks with seed heads and shake
or rub them over a container to collect seeds," she said. “Alternatively, you can
bag the heads, let them dry, then thresh."

Once you have your bounty, Eide says you’ll need to get them ready for storage.
"Ensure the seed is completely dry before storing in a sealed container to prevent
mold," says Eide.

Eide says you can roast the seeds to enhance flavor, help with drying, and kill
potential pests after they have been harvested.

Common Problems When Growing Cumin

When it comes to cumin, you’ll have to be on the lookout for a few hazards, like
bugs and fungus. "Aphids can damage plants, manually remove or allow beneficial
insects to balance populations," Eide says. 

To keep those bugs at bay, Eide says you should try and plant some companion plants
(like dill) that will attract beneficial insects that can help keep troublesome
pests under control. "Look for beneficial ladybugs, lacewings, and wasps that are
attracted to these plants," she says. "They will seek out insects like aphids on
surrounding plants."

Query says you’ll also need to be on the lookout for powdery mildew, which looks
like flour dusted on the leaves. "Make sure your cumin plants have good airflow and
water at the root base instead of overhead," she says.

Lastly, you’ll want to beware of fusarium wilt, which Query says is a fungal pest
that yellows leaves. "Prevent by rotating your crops annually—don't plant cumin or
any of its family members like carrots, parsley, or celery in the same place two
years in a row—and make sure your soil has excellent drainage," says Query.
