Growing Barley: a guide for beginners

By  /

Growing barley can be a rewarding experience for beginner farmers. Barley is an
easy-to-grow crop that has several valuable advantages. It can be used as an animal
and human food source, or as a way to protect topsoil during drought conditions.

Barley is a cereal crop that belongs to the grass family. It is a hardy crop that
can grow in a wide range of soil types and climates. Barley can be grown in spring
and winter, depending on the variety and the region. Spring barley is typically
sown in the early spring, while winter barley is sown in the fall and harvested in
the following summer.

In this article, we will provide you with step-by-step guidance on how to grow
barley for beginner farmers. We will cover all aspects of growing barley, from
selecting the right variety to harvesting and storing the crop. Whether you are
looking to grow barley for personal consumption or as a commercial crop, this guide
will provide you with all the information you need to get started.

Understanding Barley Basics

When it comes to growing barley, there are a few key basics that every beginner
farmer should know. In this section, we’ll cover the different barley varieties,
the growth stages of barley, and how barley compares to wheat.

Barley Varieties

There are two main types of barley: spring barley and winter barley. Spring barley
is planted in the spring and harvested in the summer, while winter barley is
planted in the fall and harvested in the spring. Within these two categories, there
are two main varieties of barley: two-row and six-row. Two-row barley has two rows
of grains on each head, while six-row barley has six rows of grains.

Barley Growth Stages

Barley goes through several developmental phases during its growth cycle. The first
phase is germination, where the seed begins to sprout and grow roots. The next
phase is tillering, where the plant begins to grow multiple stems from the base of
the plant. After tillering, the plant enters the stem elongation phase, where the
stems begin to grow taller. Finally, the plant enters the ripening phase, where the
grains begin to mature and the plant is ready for harvest.

Barley vs Wheat

While barley and wheat are both cereal crops, there are some key differences
between the two. Barley is generally easier to grow than wheat and can be grown in
a wider range of soil types. Barley also has a shorter growing season than wheat,
making it a good option for farmers who want to plant multiple crops in a single
growing season. However, wheat generally yields more than barley and is more
versatile in terms of its uses, such as in baking and brewing.

Pre-Planting Preparation

Before planting barley, there are several crucial steps that must be taken to
ensure a successful crop. In this section, we will cover the soil requirements,
selecting quality seeds, and optimal sowing date.

Soil Requirements

Barley grows best in well-drained soil with a pH between 6.0 and 7.5. It is
important to test the soil before planting to determine its fertility and pH level.
If the soil is too acidic, lime should be added to raise the pH level. On the other
hand, if the soil is too alkaline, sulfur can be added to lower the pH level.

Soil moisture and temperature are also important factors to consider before
planting. Barley requires adequate soil moisture for germination and early growth.
However, excessive moisture can lead to disease and poor growth. The ideal soil
temperature for planting barley is between 5°C and 10°C.

Selecting Quality Seeds

Selecting high-quality seeds is essential for a successful crop. It is important to
choose seeds that are certified and free from diseases. The seed rate will depend
on the variety of barley being planted and the desired plant population. Typically,
a seed rate of 100-120 kg per hectare is recommended.

Optimal Sowing Date

The optimal sowing date for barley depends on the location and climate. In general,
barley should be sown in the early spring when soil temperatures are between 5°C
and 10°C. However, in warmer regions, barley can be sown in the winter. It is
important to avoid sowing barley too early or too late as this can lead to poor
growth and yield.

Land preparation is also an important step before planting. Seed-bed preparation on
most soils needs to be done with as few cultivation passes as possible, so that
costs are contained, weed numbers are reduced, and soil moisture is retained.

In summary, before planting barley, it is important to test the soil, select
high-quality seeds, and determine the optimal sowing date. By following these steps
and ensuring proper land preparation, we can increase the chances of a successful
crop.

Planting Barley

When it comes to planting barley, there are a few key factors that beginner farmers
need to keep in mind. In this section, we will cover the sowing techniques, row
spacing and depth, and water and irrigation requirements for growing barley
successfully.

Sowing Techniques

Before planting barley, it is essential to prepare the soil properly. We recommend
ploughing the soil to a depth of at least 6 inches and removing any weeds or
debris. Once the soil is prepared, you can begin sowing the barley seeds.

There are two main sowing techniques that you can use: broadcasting and drilling.
Broadcasting involves scattering the seeds across the field by hand or using a
spreader. Drilling, on the other hand, involves using a seed drill to plant the
seeds in rows. We recommend using the drilling technique, as it allows for more
precise seed placement and better plant population control.

Row Spacing and Depth

The spacing between rows and the depth of the seeds will depend on the variety of
barley you are planting. In general, the rows should be spaced between 6 and 10
inches apart, and the seeds should be planted at a depth of around 1 to 2 inches.

It is important to ensure that the seeds are planted at the correct depth, as this
will affect the plant’s ability to absorb moisture and nutrients from the soil.
Planting too shallow can result in poor germination rates, while planting too deep
can lead to delayed emergence and weak plants.

Water and Irrigation

Barley requires adequate moisture to grow properly. The soil should have some
moisture during the germination period, which typically lasts between 7 and 10
days. After the plants have emerged, monitor the soil moisture levels, so the
plants don’t suffer drought- although in the UK it is usually not an issue.

Barley Crop Management

When it comes to barley crop management, there are a few key aspects that beginner
farmers should pay attention to in order to ensure a successful harvest. In this
section, we will cover nutrient management, weed and pest control, as well as
disease prevention.

Nutrient Management

Barley requires a balanced supply of nutrients to grow and develop properly. Soil
testing is an important first step to determine the nutrient requirements of your
crop. Based on the results, you may need to apply fertiliser to your soil to
supplement any deficiencies. Nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium are the primary
macronutrients that barley needs, while micronutrients such as zinc, iron, and
manganese are also important.

It is important to apply fertiliser at the right time and in the right amount.
Over-fertilising can lead to lodging and disease issues, while under-fertilising
can result in poor yields. Always follow the recommended application rates and
timings, and avoid applying fertiliser during periods of drought or heavy rainfall.

Weed and Pest Control

Weeds can have a significant impact on barley yields, so effective weed control is
essential. Blackgrass is a common weed that can be difficult to control, so it is
important to monitor your fields regularly and take action as soon as you spot any
weeds. Cultural control methods such as crop rotation and tillage can be effective,
as can herbicides.

Applying sprays can help keep disease and pests in barley crops to a minimum.

Pests such as aphids and armyworms can also cause damage to your barley crop. Early
detection and action are important to prevent damage from becoming too severe.
Pesticides can be effective in controlling pests, but it is important to use them
responsibly and follow all safety guidelines.

Disease Prevention

Barley is susceptible to a range of diseases, including powdery mildew, net blotch,
and scald. Disease prevention starts with selecting disease-resistant varieties and
ensuring good crop hygiene. Crop rotation can also help to reduce disease pressure.
Fungicides can be used to control disease, but it is important to use them
judiciously and follow all safety guidelines.

In conclusion, effective barley crop management involves careful attention to
nutrient management, weed and pest control, and disease prevention. By following
best practices and monitoring your crop regularly, you can ensure a successful
harvest.

Monitoring Barley Growth

As beginner farmers, it is important to monitor the growth of your barley crop to
ensure that it is developing as expected. In this section, we will discuss some key
aspects of monitoring barley growth, including growth tracking and adjustments,
climate and weather impact, and using technology for crop monitoring.

Growth Tracking and Adjustments

To monitor the growth of your barley crop, it is important to track its progress
through the key growth stages of emergence, tillering, and flowering. By doing so,
you can make adjustments to your management practices as needed to ensure optimal
growth and yield.

One way to track the growth of your barley crop is to use a growth stage chart,
which can help you identify which growth stage your crop is in and what management
practices are appropriate for that stage. For example, during the tillering stage,
it is important to ensure that your crop has adequate nutrients and water to
support the development of tillers.

If you notice that your crop is not developing as expected, it may be necessary to
make adjustments to your management practices. For example, if you notice that your
crop is not tillering as expected, you may need to adjust your fertilization or
irrigation practices to ensure that your crop has the nutrients and water it needs
to grow.

Climate and Weather Impact

The climate and weather can have a significant impact on the growth of your barley
crop. Temperature, humidity, and rainfall can all affect the growth and development
of your crop, and it is important to monitor these factors to ensure that your crop
is developing as expected.

For example, frost can damage emerging barley plants, so it is important to monitor
the weather and take steps to protect your crop if frost is expected. Similarly, if
rainfall is below average, you may need to adjust your irrigation practices to
ensure that your crop has adequate water.

Using Technology for Crop Monitoring

Advances in technology have made it easier than ever to monitor the growth of your
barley crop. For example, EOSDA crop monitoring technology can provide real-time
data on the growth and development of your crop, allowing you to make adjustments
to your management practices as needed.

By using technology to monitor your crop, you can identify potential issues early
on and take steps to address them before they become a problem. This can help you
ensure that your barley crop develops as expected and yields the best possible
harvest.

Harvesting and Post-Harvest

After months of hard work, it is time to harvest our barley crop. Harvesting is a
crucial step in the barley production process, and it requires careful planning and
execution to ensure that we get the best quality grain. In this section, we will
discuss the different aspects of harvesting and post-harvest management.

Determining the Right Time to Harvest

The first step in harvesting barley is to determine the right time to harvest. The
maturity of the barley plant is a critical factor in determining the right time to
harvest. We must wait until the barley has reached its full maturity before we can
harvest it. The best way to determine maturity is to look at the colour of the
barley heads. When the heads turn golden brown, it is a sign that the barley is
mature and ready for harvest. We can also check the moisture content of the grain
to determine maturity. The ideal moisture content for harvesting is between 14% and
18%.

Harvesting Techniques

Once we have determined that the barley is mature, we can begin the harvesting
process. There are different harvesting techniques that we can use, depending on
the size of our farm and the equipment available. For small farms, we can use a
sickle or scythe to cut the barley by hand. For larger farms, we can use a combine
harvester, which is a machine that cuts and threshes the barley in one operation.

One of the challenges we may face during harvesting is lodging. Lodging is when the
barley plants fall over due to strong winds or heavy rain. Lodging can make it
difficult to harvest the barley, and it can also reduce the yield and quality of
the grain. To avoid lodging, we must ensure that the barley is planted in
well-drained soil and that we do not over-fertilize the crop.

Storage and Market Preparation

After harvesting, we must store the barley properly to ensure that it maintains its
quality. The ideal storage conditions for barley are cool and dry. We can store the
barley in a silo or grain bin, or we can bag it in moisture-proof bags. We must
also ensure that the barley is free from pests and diseases.

Once the barley is stored, we can begin the market preparation process. We must
clean the barley to remove any foreign matter and damaged grains. We can also test
the specific weight and grain nitrogen content of the barley to determine its
quality. The specific weight is a measure of the weight of the barley per unit
volume, and it is an indicator of the grain’s density. The grain nitrogen content
is a measure of the protein content of the grain, and it is an essential factor in
determining the grain’s value.

Barley Uses and Market Opportunities

As a beginner farmer, it’s important to understand the various uses and market
opportunities for barley. By doing so, we can make informed decisions about how to
grow and sell our crops.

Barley in Food and Beverage

Barley is a versatile crop that has been used in food and beverage production for
centuries. It is a key ingredient in beer production, providing the fermentable
sugars that yeast convert into alcohol. It is also used in the production of malt,
which is added to beer to give it flavour and colour.

Aside from its use in beer and malt production, barley is also used in food
production. It is a nutritious grain that can be used in a variety of recipes, from
soups and stews to salads and breakfast cereals.

Barley as Animal Feed

Barley is a popular crop for animal feed, particularly for livestock such as
cattle, sheep, and pigs. It is a good source of energy and protein, and is often
included in feed mixes to help animals gain weight and build muscle.

Barley can also be used as a forage crop, providing high-quality feed for grazing
animals. It is a hardy crop that can be grown in a variety of conditions, making it
a popular choice for farmers.

Economic Aspects of Growing Barley

Growing barley can be a profitable venture for beginner farmers. The crop is
relatively easy to grow and requires minimal inputs, making it a cost-effective
option.

In addition to its use as a food and animal feed crop, barley can also be sold for
malting and brewing purposes. This can be a lucrative market, particularly for
farmers who are able to produce high-quality barley that meets the strict
requirements of the malting and brewing industries.

Sustainable Barley Farming Practices

As responsible farmers, we are always looking for ways to grow our crops
sustainably. Barley farming is no exception, and there are several sustainable
practices that we can adopt to improve soil health, reduce greenhouse gas
emissions, and protect the environment. In this section, we will discuss some of
the most effective sustainable barley farming practices.

Crop Rotation and Soil Health

Crop rotation is a key practice in sustainable farming. By rotating crops, we can
reduce soil erosion, improve soil structure, and increase organic matter. Barley is
an excellent crop to include in a rotation as it is a good break crop for cereals,
and it can help to reduce weed and disease pressure. When planning crop rotations,
it is important to consider the nitrogen supply of the soil. Barley requires a good
supply of nitrogen, and it is important to ensure that the previous crop has left
enough residual nitrogen in the soil.

Organic Barley Farming

Organic barley farming is another sustainable practice that we can adopt. Organic
farming practices rely on natural inputs and processes to manage pests, diseases,
and soil fertility. Organic barley farming can help to reduce the environmental
impact of farming by reducing the use of synthetic fertilisers and pesticides.
Organic barley is also in high demand, and it can command a premium price.

Environmental Benefits

Growing barley can provide several environmental benefits. Barley is a good crop
for erosion control, and it can help to reduce soil loss and improve soil health.
Barley also has a lower carbon footprint than other crops, and it can help to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, barley is an excellent crop for
wildlife, and it can provide habitat and food for birds and insects.

Sustainable farming practices are essential for the long-term health of our farms
and the environment. By adopting practices such as crop rotation, adding organic
matter, and erosion control, we can improve soil health, reduce greenhouse gas
emissions, and protect the environment.
