temperature must be at least 40°F (4°C) for germination.

White salsify roots sauteed or steamed have a delicate flavor similar to that of
oysters. (Salsify is often called “oyster plant”.) Scorzonera is commonly called
black salsify; it is black-skinned and white-fleshed and has a flavor considered to
be superior to that of salsify.

Salsify and scorzonera grow best when temperatures are between 55° and 75°F
(13-24°C). Both are long-season crops that need at least 100 days to mature.

In short-growing season regions, the yield may be good, but smaller. Where summer
weather is very warm, the texture and flavor will not be as good.

Salsify and scorzonera are best planted in humus-rich, well-drained soil. Loosen the
soil to a depth of 10 inches and remove any stones or clods, which will cause
misshapen roots. Avoid using fresh manure which can cause roots to fork.

Salsify and scorzonera roots can be dug as soon as they are useable size. The best
flavor occurs when freezing weather touches the crop before harvest.
