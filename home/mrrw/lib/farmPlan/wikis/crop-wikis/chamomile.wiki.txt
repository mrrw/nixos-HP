Chamomile flowers are used to make tea. Chamomile tea has a fresh, clean flavor
that is immediately soothing.

There are two chamomiles: Roman chamomile (botanical name Chamaemelum nobile) and
German chamomile (botanical name Matricaria recutita or Matricaria chamomilla).
Both are members of the Asteraceae daisy family.
Roman chamomile has a fragrance and flavor similar to that of freshly cut hay.
German chamomile has a scent and flavor similar to apples. For many, German
chamomile is favored; tea made from German chamomile is sweet; tea made from Roman
chamomile can be bitter.

Chamomile is an herb. German chamomile is an annual. Roman chamomile is a
perennial. Roman chamomile grows to about 8 inches tall and 18 inches wide. German
chamomile grows 24 inches tall and wide. Chamomile has finely cut, feathery leaves
and daisylike flowers to 1-inch across in late summer and autumn.

German chamomile is often cultivated for its essential oils and aromatic flowers
that are used in tea. Roman chamomile is often used as a ground cover or lawn
replacement, but it also can be used to make tea or as a garnish in the kitchen.
The German variety is the best choice for tea.

Here is your complete guide to growing chamomile!

Chamomile propagation

  • German chamomile is easy to grow from seed, however, seed-starting success is
    less than 50 percent. Keep the seed moist for germination.
  • Roman chamomile is propagated by seed, division, or cuttings. The germination
    rate is 40 to 60 percent. Division is the easiest method of propagation. Grows
    best in USDA Zones 4-9.
  • Divide the plant’s rhizomatous roots to start new plants or root 3- to 5-inch
    cuttings indoors in pots in early spring or in midsummer.

Where to plant chamomile

  • Best location: Both chamomiles—Roman and German—prefer to grow in full sun but
    will tolerate partial shade.
  • Soil preparation: Roman chamomile prefers light, compost-rich, evenly moist
    soil. German chamomile prefers well-drained sandy soils; if your soil is moist,
    plant German chamomile in a raised bed. Both prefer a soil pH of 6.5 to 7.5.
    Add 2 or more inches of aged compost to the planting bed and turn it under
    before planting. Always amend heavy clay soil with plenty of organic compost
    before planting chamomile.

When to plant chamomile

  • Seed starting indoors: Chamomile can be started indoors 3 or 4 weeks before
    transplanting to the garden. Sow seed in organic potting mix in flats or pots
    under fluorescent light. Keep the tiny seeds moist or germination will be
    difficult. German chamomile seeds germinate in about 14 days at 55° to 65°
    Roman chamomile germinates best in warm soil, about 70°F.
  • Transplanting to the garden: Seedlings started indoors can be transplanted out
    after 3 to 5 weeks when all risk of frost is past, about 2 to 3 weeks after the
    average last frost date.
  • Outdoor planting time: Sow both types of chamomile in the garden after all
    danger of frost has passed when the soil temperature has reached 55°F to 60°F.
    Chamomile should be planted before late spring so that roots can become
    established before hot weather arrives.
  • Division: Divide cultivars in spring; division is important because cultivars
    do not produce seeds.

How to plant chamomile

  • Planting depth: Sow chamomile seeds ¼ to ½ inch deep; sow seeds 2 inches apart.
  • Spacing: Thin chamomile seedlings when they are 1 to 2 inches tall. Allow 6 to
    8 inches between German chamomile plants and 18 inches between Roman chamomile
    plants.
  • How much to plant: Grow 40 chamomile plants for tea and preservation.

Chamomile companion planting and ornamental use

  • Companion planting: Plant chamomile with lavender, rosemary, and hyssop.
    Chamomile is said to aid the growth of cucumbers, onions, and most herbs. Some
    say chamomile improves the flavor and growth of cabbages, onions, and aromatic
    herbs. Chamomile flowers attract beneficial insects including hoverflies and
    predatory wasps.
  • Ornamental use: Roman chamomile can be planted among stepping stones in a
    garden path. It can be used as a ground cover in a garden bed. A chamomile lawn
    can be planted to attract pollinators to the garden. German chamomile is often
    grown as a wildflower with asters, rudbeckia, and solidago in a cottage,
    natural, or wildflower garden.

Watering and feeding chamomile

  • Watering: Chamomile grows best in that is soil evenly moist but not wet. Give
    chamomile an inch of water each week.
  • Feeding: Side dress chamomile with aged compost or feed plants with a dilute
    solution of fish emulsion.

Chamomile care and maintenance

  • Care: Plants can be cut back in early spring to renew growth. Low-growing Roman
    chamomile can be cut with a lawnmower in early spring to encourage fuller
    growth. Keep the area around chamomile weed-free; it is a poor competitor
    against weeds.

Container growing chamomile

  • Grow chamomile in a container at least 8 inches wide and deep. German chamomile
    requires a large container and will fill a pot. Low-growing Roman chamomile is
    often grown in containers as an accent.
  • Set chamomile in containers in sunny spots and keep the soil just moist.
  • Place chamomile growing indoors in a sunny window or under grow lights or
    fluorescent lights; plants need about 12 hours of light each day.

Chamomile pests and diseases

  • Both chamomiles are generally pest-free and disease-free. Aphids, thrips, and
    mealybugs may occasionally attack chamomile; wash these sap-sucking pests away
    with a strong stream of water.
  • Roman chamomile is said to help control damping-off disease when mixed with
    water and used as a spray.
  • Powdery mildew–a fungal disease–can occasionally attack chamomile. Good air
    circulation will keep fungal diseases at bay.

 How to harvest chamomile

  • When to harvest: Chamomile flowers are ripe when the petals curl back toward
    the center in late summer or early fall. Harvest when chamomile is in full
    bloom.
  • How to harvest: Cut whole stems and flowers of German chamomile. Pinch off the
    flowers of Roman chamomile.
  • Chamomile flowers are small; it may be easiest to cut flowers with stems
    attached using garden shears,

Chamomile in the kitchen

Chamomile has several culinary uses:

  • Flowers: Use the flowers freshly picked or dried. Flowers can be added to fruit
    salads or to decorate cakes.
  • Both German and Roman chamomile flowers are used to decorate cakes. The small
    flowers can be added to green or fruit salads.
  • Flowers for tea: Both chamomiles make excellent teas. The dried flower heads of
    German chamomile are sweeter flavored. To make tea: Fill teakettle water and
    begin heating. Place chamomile fresh flowers (about four tablespoons per
    eight-ounce cup) or dried flowers (about two tablespoons per eight-ounce cup)
    and a sprig of mint in a sieve or strainer or cheesecloth in your cup (or place
    flowers in a tea ball); pour boiling water over the chamomile flowers and mint
    and then steep for 5 minutes.
  • Fresh chamomile flowers make a delicious tea when combined with spearmint
    leaves; serve this tea iced or hot.
  • Drink the tea sparingly, no more than 1/2 cup of chamomile tea daily for no
    more than two weeks at a time,
  • Note: Do not use chamomile during pregnancy.

Health uses of chamomile

  • Infusion of flowers can be used to relieve stress, indigestion, nausea, fever,
    insomnia, hay fever, hyperactivity, rheumatic pain, and menstrual cramps.
  • Externally, a chamomile rinse can be used for dandruff, facial tonic, lotion,
    cream, steam, hand soak, eye compress, or in the bath. Chamomile beauty
    products are available commercially.
  • Chamomile has some popular medicinal use as an ointment for muscle spasms, oil
    for wounds, sunburn, eczema, or itchy skin.
  • Caution: people allergic to ragweed who use chamomile as an herbal remedy may
    react to its essential oils.

Dried chamomile leaves and flowers

 Preserving and storing chamomile

  • Drying: Dry chamomile flowers on a screen or in a loose paper bag in a cool
    place with good air circulation. Watch for insects that can hide in the
    flowers; if you see insects pour hot water on the flowers and dry them again.
  • Storing: Store flowers in an airtight container.
