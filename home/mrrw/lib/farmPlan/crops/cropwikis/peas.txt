Peas, please! The sweet taste of glorious garden-grown peas is nothing like what you
find in grocery stores. These green beauties are nature’s candy fresh off the vine!
Peas are one of the season’s first crops, planted as soon as the ground can be
worked, even if snow falls afterward. See our tips on growing peas, from sowing and
growing to harvest and storage!

About Peas

Peas are easy to grow, but their growing period is limited. It’s essential to plant
them early enough in spring so they mature while the weather is still cool! (This
means planting in most parts of the United States and Canada in February, March, or
April.) However, they can also be grown as a fall or winter crop in warmer regions.

Peas do not stay fresh long after harvest, so enjoy their taste as soon as possible!
Those peas in grocery stores are often starchy in taste, which you’ll find has no
comparison to garden-fresh peas.

Three varieties of peas suit most garden and culinary needs:

  • Sweet peas, aka garden peas or English peas (Pisum sativum ssp. sativum), have
    inedible pods from which the seeds (peas) are taken.
  • Snow peas (P. sativum var. macrocarpon) produce edible, flat, stringless pods
    containing small peas.
  • Snap peas (P. sativum var. macrocarpon ser. cv.) produce thick, edible pods
    containing large/full-size peas.

Great planting companions for peas include: Chives, Mint, Alyssum, Carrot, Corn,
Cucumber, Radish, Turnip, and Beans. Learn more about Companion Planting.

Planting

Select a sunny location and well-draining soil. Although peas can grow in part shade,
they won’t be as sweet or productive as those grown in full sun. Prepare the soil,
preferably in the fall, mixing in aged manure and/or compost, and mulch well—peas
like well-draining soil.

When to Plant Peas

  • Sow seeds 4 to 6 weeks before the last spring frost date when the soil is cool,
    or when it is at the desired temperature. Peas planted in cold (40°F) soil will
    germinate slowly; peas planted in soil that is at least 60°FF (but not more than
    85°F) will catch up.
  • Snow will not hurt emerging pea plants, but several days with temperatures in the
    teens might. Be prepared to plant again if the first peas don’t make it.
    Alternatively, try starting your peas in a cold frame.
  • A second round of peas can be planted in the late summer or early fall,
    approximately 6 to 8 weeks before your first fall frost date.

Here are some more tips on when to start planting peas.

How to Plant Peas

  • Peas are best direct-seeded right in the ground and do not like their roots
    disturbed. But transplanting is possible if you start seeds in biodegradable
    pots; you’ll transplant the pot and all into the garden, and the pot
    will disintegrate.
  • Where spring is long and wet, plant seeds in raised garden beds.
  • To speed germination, soak seeds in water overnight before planting.
  • Sow seeds 1 inch deep (slightly deeper if the soil is dry) and about 2 inches
    apart. Do not thin.
  • Plant rows 7 inches apart.
  • Regarding crop rotation, do not plant peas in the same place more than once every
    four years.
  • Like those of other legumes, pea roots fix nitrogen in the soil, making it
    available for other plants. 
  • In terms of fertilizer, peas need phosphorus and potassium, but excess nitrogen
    will encourage foliage growth instead of flowers or pods. Learn more about soil
    amendments.
  • Bush peas can reach 18 to 30 inches tall.  Pole types can grow at least 4 to 6
    feet tall. Both types benefit from support (especially bush peas above 2 feet and
    all pole peas). Install thin tree branches or twiggy sticks (pea sticks),
    trellises, chicken wire, strings, or netting before plants establish their
    shallow roots. See instructions on how to build trellises and supports for peas.
  • Water to keep the soil moist. If seeds wash out of the soil, poke them back
    into it.

Peas on St. Patrick’s Day

It’s an old American tradition to plant peas on St. Patrick’s Day! Our retired
editor, Janice, shows us her trick on how to plant peas in early spring if
there’s snow! 

St. Patrick’s Day (March 17) is the traditional day for planting peas, one of the
easiest plants to grow. It’s said to bring luck come harvest time. And it makes
sense: Soil is typically thawed and workable, and these veggies prefer to get started
in chilly spring weather.

Growing

  • Water peas sparsely with no more than 1 inch per week, unless the plants are
    wilting. We don’t want to encourage pea rot. But also do not let the plants dry
    out. If this happens, no pods will be produced. 
  • Gently remove intrusive weeds by hand. If necessary, hoe or cultivate, but
    carefully avoid disturbing peas’ shallow, fragile roots. 
  • Pea leaves turn yellow for several reasons. Often, this is due to the stress of
    hot weather. Provide partial shade (e.g., row covers) and water properly during
    the hottest time of day.
  • Fertilizing plants is not usually required if the plants are mulched deeply with
    grass clippings, shredded leaves, or another biodegradable material.

Types

Shelling Peas: Also known as garden or sweet peas, these are the most common types of
peas available. Some good varieties to try include:

  • ‘Green Arrow’: 2- to 3-foot vines; no support required; high yields; tolerant of
    mildew and Fusarium wilt
  • ‘Lincoln’: 2- to 3-foot vines; no support required; tolerant of mildew and
    Fusarium wilt
  • The classic ‘Wando’ (suitable for freezing)
  • ‘Thomas Laxton’ (high sugar content)
  • ‘Progress No. 9’ (good disease resistance)
  • ‘Little Marvel’ (grows only 15 inches tall)

Snap Peas: You eat the entire tender pod of snap peas. Some good varieties to
try are:

  • ‘Sugar Ann’: vines grow only 2 feet tall, no support required.
  • ‘Sugar Snap’: The original (Calvin’s) just brought back. Carried only by Johnny’s
    Selected Seeds.
  • ‘Early Snap’: An early-maturing version produces peas 10 to 14 days earlier than
    ‘Sugar Snap’
  • ‘Super Sugar Mel’: produces 4-inch-long, very sweet pods

Snow Peas: Common in Chinese cooking, these flat-podded peas have edible pods. Some
good varieties to try include:

  • ‘Mammoth Melting Sugar’ (wilt tolerant): 4- to 5-foot vines; stringless pods
  • ‘Oregon Sugar Pod II’: grows only 2-1/2 feet tall
  • ‘Snowbird’: resistant to fusarium wilt

Harvesting

How do you know when peas are ready to be picked?

Most varieties of peas are ready to harvest 60 to 70 days after planting. Peas mature
quickly, so check daily once you see the flowers in bloom.

  • Pick snow peas when the delicate pods begin to show immature seeds inside.
  • Gather snap peas when the pods become plump yet are still glossy and filled with
    sweet-tasting peas.
  • Pick shell peas before the pods become waxy.

How to Harvest Peas

  • Harvest peas in the morning after the dew has dried. They are crispiest then.
  • Harvest regularly to encourage more pods to develop. 
  • Use two hands when you pick peas to avoid damaging the plant. Hold the vine with
    one hand and pull the pods off with the other.
  • Peas are at the peak of flavor immediately after harvest.
  • Pea pods that have hardened or turned a dull color are overmature. Mature plants
    usually stop producing and die back in hot summer weather.
  • If you missed your peas’ peak period, you can still pick, dry, and shell them for
    use in winter soups.

How to Store Peas

  • Store peas in the refrigerator for about five days. Place in paper bags, then
    wrap in plastic.
  • Or, freeze peas: Shell sweet peas, blanch, immerse in cold water, drain, and pack
    in sealed containers.
  • De-string/trim snow or snap peas and prepare as above.

Wit and Wisdom

  • If a girl finds nine peas in a pod, the next bachelor she meets will become
    her husband.
  • According to folklore, St. Patrick’s Day is the traditional day for planting peas
    (in many regions).
  • Legend has it that the phrase “green thumb” originated during the reign of King
    Edward I of England, who was fond of green peas and kept six serfs shelling them
    during the season. The serf who had the greenest thumb won a prize!
  • Peas have also been used for genetic research! Gregor Mendel conducted several
    experiments with this vegetable. According to PennState, “In the mid-1800s, he
    conducted a number of experiments using garden peas at the monastery where he
    lived. He selected peas for his experiments because they were easy to grow and he
    could grow multiple crops in one season. His research produced the Mendel Laws of
    Inheritance: The Law of Dominance, The Law of Segregation, and The Law of
    Independent Assortment. This was groundbreaking scientific work. His laws also
    apply to human genetics.”

Cooking Notes

Ideally, use peas when freshly picked as they rapidly toughen and will lose
their sweetness. 

Green peas can be eaten raw as a snack or in salads. Peas are also excellent in
pasta, soups, casseroles, stir-fries, and sautés. Cooking times vary greatly
depending on when the green peas were harvested. Young, small ones require less
cooking than older, starchy ones.

To steam, put 1 inch of water in a pot, bring to a boil, place a steaming basket in
the pan, slowly add peas to the steaming basket, and cover with a lid. Steam for
about 2 minutes. Or, to microwave, put 2 tablespoons of water in a microwavable dish
and cover. Microwave on high, checking every 2 minutes for doneness.  Add butter and
salt as desired.

Interestingly, the pea tendrils are also edible! Harvest these young pea shoots when
they are 12 to 18 inches out of the ground. As with peas, eat the tender shoots soon
after harvesting. Add to salads or in stir-fries at the end of cooking.

I grow snow peas, eating them as they grow, right in the garden. Friends come to
chat, we go out and feast on snow peas while catching up. Much better than cookies.

To shell peas more easily, blanch first then shell them. They pop right out of the
shells very easily and fast.

What about southern peas? Black eye, purple hull, etc? I know they're more a warm
weather crop but what about planting by the moon??

Hi, I’ve been picking my snow peas for a month now and most grew this last week. I
picked a few that are developed inside but still in pod. Can I use these for planting
next year? I know I should have left them on the vine. Can I let them dry and use or
just eat them now?

When I studied Biology we were taught that the seeds or seed coverings (the sexual
reproduction part of the plant was fruit as opposed to roots, stems and leaves.
Question: Why is a pea not a fruit, but a vegetable?
