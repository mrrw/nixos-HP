Recommended Starting Methods

For the best success, it is super important to use the right method for planting
carrot seeds – and that is direct sowing.

I don’t recommend starting them indoors or winter sowing them. That’s because
transplanting carrot seedlings almost always causes the roots to become deformed.

So don’t waste your time experimenting. Stick to planting them directly in your
garden for the best success.

give them to mature.

Planting Carrot Seeds

No matter what variety you choose, the planting process is always the same. In this
section, I’ll tell you exactly when and how to plant carrot seeds.

When To Plant Carrot Seeds

For those of us who live in a cold area, the best time to plant carrot seeds is as
soon as the ground is workable in very early spring.

If you live in a warm climate, sow them in the fall once the weather cools down, or
in early winter.

How To Plant Carrot Seeds Step-By-Step

Carrot seeds are easy to plant, so there’s no need to get anxious. But if you want
everything to go smoothly, it is best to have all of your supplies ready first.

Supplies Needed

  • Seeds
  • Hand trowel
  • Water
  • Organic soil amendments (worm castings, compost, or granular fertilizer –
    optional)

Instructions

Step 1: Prepare the soil – Before planting carrot seeds, make sure you loosen up the
soil, and remove any impediments, like sticks or rocks. Otherwise, they can inhibit
healthy root development.

I also recommend amending your soil with compost or worm castings, and then mixing in
an organic fertilizer.

Step 2: Determine the spacing – Since they don’t require a ton of space, you can
plant your carrot seeds 1″ apart. Or, if you prefer, you can just scatter them in
rows, and thin them out later.

Step 3: Plant the seeds – Make shallow trenches or holes in the soil, then drop the
seeds in. Or, sprinkle them over the top, then gently work them down to about 1/4″
deep.

I like to use my finger to draw a shallow line in the dirt, then thinly sprinkle them
into the trench I created.

Planting carrot seeds in my garden

Step 4: Cover the seeds – Once you’re done planting, push the dirt back over them,
and gently pack it down. That way, you’ll ensure the soil will come into contact with
the seeds.

Step 5: Water – Moisten the soil in the bed using the lowest setting on your garden
hose.

Using a gentle stream will ensure that you don’t displace the tiny seeds. The soil
should be evenly moist, but never soggy.

Carrot Seed Germination Time

The amount of time it takes carrot seeds to germinate can also vary. They are a bit
slow, and it can take anywhere from 14-20 days to sprout.

So be patient, and don’t get discouraged if it seems to be taking forever. During
this time, make sure the soil never dries out, or it can inhibit germination.

What Do Carrot Seedlings Look Like?

When they first pop out of the ground, carrot seedlings have two long and narrow
leaves. Those are called the “seed leaves”.

All of the rest that form after that are called “true leaves”, and they look just
like tiny baby carrot leaves.

How To Care For Carrot Seedlings

The work doesn’t end when your carrot seeds sprout. You will get the best results if
you also ensure the seedlings are well cared for.

Water

For the best success, always keep the soil evenly moist, but never soggy. Dry or wet
soil can kill the delicate seedlings. Use a moisture gauge to get it just right.

Fertilizer

Once your carrot seedlings have their first few true leaves, start feeding them with
a liquid fertilizer at half strength. They love compost tea or fish emulsion too.

Thinning

If you didn’t have the patience to space them out properly when you planted your
carrot seeds, you’ll need to thin the seedlings. Just make sure you never pull them
out, or it could cause major damage to the ones nearby.

FAQs

Below I’ve answered some of the most common questions about growing carrots from
seed. If you still have a question after reading though this section, ask it in the
comments below.

How many carrot seeds do you plant per hole?

When sowing fresh carrot seeds, you can plant one per hole. But if you’re using old
seeds, place 2-3 per hole, and thin them later.

How deep do you plant carrot seeds?

Carrot seeds should always be planted twice as deep as they are wide – so only about
1/4″.

How can you germinate carrot seeds faster?

To help carrot seeds germinate faster, plant them in the cooler weather of spring or
fall, and always keep the soil evenly moist. You could also try soaking the seeds
before planting to help speed things up.

Do carrot seeds need light to germinate?

No, carrot seeds do not need light to germinate.

Do you soak carrot seeds before planting?

While it’s not necessary to soak carrot seeds before planting, doing so can help to
speed up and increase germination rates.

Growing carrots from seed is amazingly easy and fun. With no need for transplanting
or starting the seeds indoors, it really takes the burden out of planting them.

Carrot seeds can be finicky, but they aren't difficult to grow once you know how.
First, gather all of your supplies. Then, simply follow these easy, step by step
planting instructions.

Materials

  • Seeds
  • Water
  • Organic soil amendments (worm castings, compost, or granular fertilizer -
    optional)

Tools

  • Hand trowel

Instructions

     1. Prepare the soil - Loosen up the soil, and remove any impediments, like
        sticks or rocks. Then amend the soil with compost or worm castings, and mix
        in an organic granular fertilizer before planting.
     2. Determine the spacing - Plant your carrot seeds 1" apart. Or, if you prefer,
        you can just scatter them in rows, and thin them out once they start to grow.
     3. Plant the seeds - Make shallow trenches or holes in the soil, and drop the
        seeds in. Or, sprinkle them over the soil, then gently work them down to
        about 1/4" deep.
     4. Cover the seeds - Once you're done planting, push the dirt back over them,
        and gently pack it down to ensure the soil comes in contact with the seeds.
     5. Water - Moisten the soil using the lowest setting on your garden hose so you
        don't displace the tiny seeds. The soil should be evenly moist, but never
        soggy.

    My carrot seed sprouted but only the cotyledons came up, no tire leave even after
    2weeks. Why is this?

        It can take 2 weeks for the true leaves to start growing on carrot seedlings,
        so that’s not unusual. As long as they look green and healthy, it might just
        be a matter of time.

    My weeds took over. I can see the carrot tops coming through but I can’t figure
    out how to reduce the weeds without damaging the tender carrot plants

        If the weeds are mature and intentangled with your carrot seedlings, then it
        will be difficult for them to ever develop a sizable root. I would try
        keeping the weeds that are right next to the seedlings cut back to the
        ground, and then pulling out the rest that are far enough away. Hopefully
        cutting them back will knock them down enough so your carrots seedlings can
        take over.

    SO how do you get the carrots to look like the traditional supermarket
    long-stemmed ones? Even your pictures above have then squat and fat. That is how
    mine came out and I have a 24″ deep raised bed.

    Thank you for the information.

        Sometimes it comes down to the type of carrot seeds you planted. There are
        many different varieties, some are short and fat, while others are long and
        skinny – and everything in between. That would be the first thing I’d check.
        Also, make sure you water deeply weekly, rather than giving them a small
        amount on the surface more often. The deeper you water, the longer the roots
        will be.

    You say not to pull the seedlings so as not to disturb the other seedlings. Do
    you just pinch them off then?
    Thanks, Eric

        To thin your carrot seedings, it’s safest to cut them off at the base using a
        sharp pair of precision pruners rather than pinching them. Here’s a detailed
        article that may help you out… How & When To Thin Seedlings.

    A way to spread carrot seeds is to mix the seed with a handful of washed sand
    thoroughly and then spread evenly in your shallow trench then cover with a
    potting mix. then water regularly to keep moist .
    Works well with radishes as well. You won’t need nearly as much thinning out

        sharing! 🙂

    Hi, I live in San Juan, Puerto Rico. I planted purple carrot seeds in a pot last
    September after reading your post & in December I checked & they had not grown so
    I just forgot about them. To my surprise about two weeks ago picking some
    tomatoes I noticed the carrots had grown. Why they took so long frankly is a big
    ?

        Oh, that’s great news! Glad to hear your carrot seeds grew. I’m not sure why
        they took so long to germinate either, they have a very wide temperature
        range for germination, so I don’t think that was the problem. Maybe the the
        soil was too dry? They need consistently moist soil to germinate.

    Thanks for the tips, Amy!

    This season is my first time growing carrots. I bought the seedlings from a
    trusted nursery. I’m growing them in containers. As you recommend, they’re in
    loose soil and under full sun. Here in Puerto Rico the weather is getting much
    hotter (mid 80’s & 90’s), so i hope it doesn’t disturb them! They look very
    happy! Looking forward to harvest them in early Summer!
