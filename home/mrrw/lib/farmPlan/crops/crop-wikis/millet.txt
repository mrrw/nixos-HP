How to Grow Millet

Learn to grow millet, a fast-growing late-season crop, easily adaptable in the
kitchen, and outstrips many more common grains as a nutritional powerhouse.

Millet is grown in the United States mostly for pasture and hay. Only proso millet is
grown seriously for grain. It is used for animal feed, flour for humans, and birdseed
mixtures. It is nutritionally superior to many of our common grains, containing more
essential amino acids than wheat, oats, rice, barley, and rye. It lacks only lysine,
the amino acid buckwheat is high in, making buckwheat and millet a good combination
in your diet. Also, while most grains form acids in your stomach, millet, with its
high alkaline mineral content, counteracts acids and is more easily digested. Millet,
not rice, is the basic carbohydrate food in China, especially northern China. The
Hunzas, whose reputation for health and longevity is well known, eat millet
regularly.

The word millet is used to refer to plants in four different families, and therefore
leads to a tremendous amount of confusion, including mine. Sellers of field seed in
the United States talk about Japanese, German, Hungarian, African, common, proso,
pearl, browntop, foxtail, and variations thereof. And these terms do not necessarily
refer to the same plant in different parts of the country, either. So, armed with my
ever-trusty Taylor’s Encyclopedia of Gardening, Horticulture, and Landscape Design, 
4th ed., (Riverside Press, 1961) and supported by innumerable phone calls to seedsmen
throughout the United States, I shall attempt to identify all the millets and
colloquial names thereof. But, mind you, I won’t claim infallibility for my
categorization. One man’s colloquialism is another man’s slang.

There are three different families of millets and a fourth kind so-called, which is
not really millet at all. Let’s dispatch with this fourth one first. If you are in
Texas or surrounding states, you can buy and grow what is called “African millet.”
This plant is really a sorghum, a tall form of kafir corn with a proper name of
Sorghum unlgare var. caffrorum. It is grown for pasture and/or hay, though not
extensively. African millet might also be referred to as mock-orange cane, orange
sorghum, or even sumac, in Texas.

Proso Millet

Proso millet, Panicum miliaceum, is the only millet grown for food in the United
States. It is sometimes called broomcorn millet because the open heads of the plant
resemble small broomcorn heads. That differentiates it from the foxtail- and
cattail-shaped heads of other millets. So far as I know, no millet is sold under the
name “broomcorn millet” anymore, but interest in proso is increasing as a food grain
for the driest parts of the country. This family of millets is the one used from
earliest times for grain and flour, especially in India, China, Japan, Manchuria, and
Russia. Proso is usually milled for livestock as well as humans because the seed
coating is so hard. Chickens can handle it whole. The seeds are about the size of
peppercorns, and either red, yellow, or white in color. Newer varieties are white.

Foxtail Millet

“Foxtail” millets, Setaria italica, are grown for emergency hay, silage, and pasture,
especially where weather is invariably dry. They make better forage than proso
because they are finer-stemmed and not hairy-stemmed. What we in this part of the
country call barnyard millet is a foxtail millet that volunteers in midsummer and
grows better than other grasses in drought conditions. Once it heads out, which it
does rather quickly, the livestock don’t much like it.

So-called browntop and Japanese varieties are not always included with the foxtail
millets. That’s where scientific classification and colloquial names really get
confusing. So-called Japanese millet grows in the North; browntop in the South. Both
may grow to a height of 5 feet and will regrow after cutting, yielding more tonnage
of forage than any other millet. These millets are finer-leaved and finer-stemmed
than sorghum-Sudan grass and so dry faster for haymaking. Browntop is used in the
South for cover and feed for quail and other game birds, but a Georgia farmer I once
talked to said he considered it good hay for dairy cows, too.

Pearl Millet

The third group of millets are the pearl millets, botanical name Pennisetum glaucum, 
or P. americanum. Pearl millet, rather than resembling a small foxtail grass, looks
more like a cattail reed head, and is in fact, often called cattail millet in the
Southeast. Pearl millet is grown almost totally in the South. It threshes free from
the hulls, which might make it more desirable for the garden farmer processing millet
for table use. But it is not as desirable for grain or flour as proso.

How to Grow Millet

Millet can be planted either by broadcasting or by drill seeding, at the rate of
about 35 pounds per acre for all kinds of millet–a little more if broadcast. Don’t
worry about getting it a little deep, as it will come up from 4 inches to 5 inches
down, I’m told. But 1 inch to 3 inches is a better planting depth. Millet, like
buckwheat, can be planted late in the season. In fact, it is often grown as an
emergency crop after another grain crop has failed.

Millet won’t compete, pound for pound, as hay or pasture with legumes in nutritional
value, but it has other advantages. Thirty days after you plant it you can be using
it. No legume can make that claim. It has good insect resistance and is relatively
free of disease, which together with its ability to grow on rather poor land makes it
a desirable crop for any organic grower not wanting to use commercial fertilizers. As
hay it can produce several tons per acre in three months, and as seed, 50 bushels per
acre or more. It’s a good emergency forage when things go wrong and you need forage
fast. And, of course, the same would be true of the grain. Chickens will do well on
it; just toss them the whole stalks and let them peck out the seeds, or let them
free-range through the standing millet. And researchers, particularly in the drier
parts of the Great Plains, keep up ongoing programs at the land-grant colleges on
millet improvement. As one of them told me: “If we ever run out of irrigation water,
millet could become a very valuable food source, as it is in other dry regions of the
world.”

Nutritionists point out that proso millet is highly adaptable to various recipes, as
it has an almost bland taste, with just a slightly nutty flavor. They say that it can
easily be used by itself or in combination with other grains in casseroles, breads,
stews, soufflés, stuffings, cereals, or eaten plain with butter, gravy, or a
vegetable sauce. Brown it first in a skillet with a small amount of oil, then use it
as you would any other grain. Browning enhances the nutty flavor.

Millet Recipes

A coworker and one time Organic Living editor at Rodale Press, Ray Wolf, shared this
idea with me. “You can prepare a cereal that will serve a dual purpose by adding one
part millet, one part sesame seed meal, and five parts water to a baking casserole or
a double boiler and cooking it until done, about 45 minutes. This can be eaten as a
cereal, or allowed to cool and congeal, at which point it can be sliced or prepared
as patties, which can be used as a type of (cornmeal) mush. It can be reheated and
served with cheese melted on top.”
