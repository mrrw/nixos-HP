Planting

Full sun, hot weather, fertile, well-drained soil, and mulch are the ingredients for
a large tomatillo harvest. You’ll need at least two tomatillo plants to get them to
set fruit. They are not self-fertile. Plant them near each other to help your
pollinators get the job done.

While you might find tomatillos in your local garden center, they are less common
than tomatoes, so you may need to start them from seed. Don’t worry; they germinate
reliably. If you find tomatillo starter plants at the nursery, choose stout-stemmed
plants that have not yet flowered or started to fruit.

Tomatillos share many of the same pest issues as other nightshade family plants
(tomatoes, potatoes, eggplants, or peppers), so crop rotation is important.

When to Plant Tomatillos

Tomatillos start readily from seed but must be hardened off before going into
your garden. 

  • Start from seed 6 to 8 weeks before you wish to transplant them outdoors. They
    should have five leaves and a well-developed set of roots before being planted in
    the garden. 
  • Tomatillos enjoy the warmth and won’t grow well in cool temperatures. Soil
    temperatures should be about 60 degrees or warmer. 
  • Whether started from seed or purchased as nursery starts, plant tomatillos
    outdoors several weeks after your last frost. See our Planting Calendar for when
    to plant tomatoes in your location and plant your tomatillos at the same time.

How to Plant Tomatillos

A mature tomatillo can spread out to occupy about six square feet. Space plants every
two feet, with rows three feet apart. 

To start them from seed:

  • Prepare your trays or cell packs with a pre-moistened seed starting mix. 50-cell
    trays work well, but whatever size you have on hand will do. 
  • Sow 2 to 3 seeds per cell, about a quarter inch deep.
  • Cover with plastic wrap or a humidity dome to aid in retaining moisture.
  • Place in a warm, bright location. Tomatillo seeds germinate best above 70
    degrees. A heat mat under the tray will speed germination if your greenhouse or
    home is cold. 
  • Thin to one sprout per cell or equivalent spacing after seedlings are an inch
    tall. Snip them with scissors to avoid disturbing the roots of the remaining
    young plant.

To transplant tomatillos into your garden:

  • Work about an inch of compost into the soil. 
  • Loosen any pot-bound roots.
  • Like a tomato, plant young tomatillos deep. It’s okay, and even preferred, to
    bury a tomatillo transplant all the way up to the first set of true leaves. Deep
    planting encourages the rooting of tomatillos (and tomatoes) and provides a
    sturdy base for the young plant. 
  • Set your stakes or trellis at the same time as you transplant. Don’t wait too
    long, as I often do, and have plants sprawled all over the ground.
  • The plants can be trained onto their supports as soon as they can reach them, and
    you’ll prevent root damage caused by driving stakes or supports through the roots
    later in the season. 
     

Growing

Tomatillos are perennials but are usually raised as annuals. They can grow quite
large, so stake them to keep the fruit off the ground and support the plants. Check
out this University of Minnesota Extension page for more information on growing
tomatillos in your garden. 

  • Compost or aged manure are great additions to the native soil of your garden but
    don’t overdo it. Too much nitrogen and your tomatillos might grow like the wind
    but set little fruit.
  • Water regularly at the base of the plant. An inch to an inch and a half per week
    should suffice. Drip line irrigation is ideally suited to tomatillos.
  • If you have to water with an overhead system, do so in the morning so the leaves
    can dry out quickly and minimize the potential for disease.
  • Mulch under and around your tomatillos. Black plastic mulch can be used in the
    spring to warm the soil and lock in moisture if your soil is prone to drying out.
    Organic mulches are excellent at protecting the surface and preventing soil from
    splashing onto leaves. Natural mulches will also decay and improve your soil.

Types

  • Tomatillo ‘Purple’ grows vividly purple fruit sweeter than most green varieties.
    It is a favorite for eating fresh off the vine. The more sunshine, the ‘purpler’
    the fruit.
  • Tomatillo ‘Verde’ is an early maturing variety and a favorite for use in salsa.
    It can grow quite large, so a tomato cage or other support is helpful.
  • Tomatillo ‘Tamayo’ is a tall hybrid plant that sets large, 2.5-3 inch
    diameter fruits.

  • “Tomatillos are ripe when the fruit is firm and fills the papery husk. If green
    fruit turns yellow, it is overripe and less flavorful. The purple varieties are
    ripe when the green fruits turn purple and fill the husk,” explains Daniel Drost,
    a Vegetable Specialist at Utah State University.
  • The fruits should be firm. Overripe fruit will be softer and not keep as well.
    Harvest (or check) once or twice a week once the fruits are ripening.
  • Watch for the husks to begin turning from bright green to tan or faded green. 
  • Tomatillos will keep for 2 to 3 weeks in a paper bag on the kitchen counter or
    can be frozen for later use. 

If you notice a sticky residue on the tomatillos, wash it off before eating.

Cooking Notes

With tomatillos, the fruit inside the papery husk is eaten. The leaves, husk, and
stem are toxic and shouldn’t be eaten. Before eating the fruit, be sure to scrub the
fruit clean of any sticky husk residue. Do not remove the green peeling.

They can be eaten raw or cooked, though many people find the flavor too sour and
pungent to eat raw. If you boil them for about 8 minutes in water, they’ll become
more tender and lemony tart. Blend to make salsa verde or slice to add to recipes.

Tomatillos Salsa

For an easy salsa, chop up tomatillos (remove the stem part), and add to a skillet
with sautéed garlic and onion. Cook tomatillos for about 6 to 8 minutes, until tender
and slightly browned. That’s it! We love salsa with tortillas, tacos, fish, chicken,
beans, and cheese.

I have grown fruit with just 1 plant for years. I have never needed a 2nd to
pollinate. So don’t fret if you only have 1!

In the 1960's my Dad grew a plant very similar that I believe he called a "husk
tomato" though I'm not sure if I'm remembering that correctly. The fruit only grew to
the size of a large gooseberry, about an inch across or less, was sweet with a golden
yellow color and a tan husk when ripe. Does anyone have any idea what that could have
been? I've never seen it anywhere before or since my Dad grew it.

You may be referring to a ground cherry. I find them at the farmer's markets in the
Portland, OR area and have had some luck growing them at home. They are a tomatillo,
but have a totally different flavor. Look for varietals called Aunt Molly's or
Pineapple. I like both of them. Here is a link to some seed: https://

I too have a single tomatillo plant that I got from a local nursery last year at the
end of the season. It was not in good shape then, so only got a few fruits (I
actually only got one!). It reseeded and is doing quite well, producing nicely. It's
an Aunt Molly heirloom. It ripens to yellow and tastes mildly sweet.

Thank you Pamela! You're absolutely right. I just looked them up. I'll try some this
year. Thanks again.

Mexican folks roast the Tomatillo on a fire-grill; they use this to make the Salsa
with very hot peppers; which are also grill-roasted; 'too hot for me"!~
