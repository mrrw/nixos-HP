Ever been told to “eat your greens?” Kale is one of the most nutritious vegetables
you can grow. It’s crammed with vitamins and powerful antioxidants, and it tastes
de-licious. Kale is a hardy cool-season crop that grows best in spring and fall,
tolerating frost and even snow. Learn how to plant, grow, and harvest kale. 

About Kale

Kale is a cold-hardy, resilient, non-heading green. It’s one of the easiest members
of the brassica family to grow (which includes cabbage, broccoli, brussels sprouts,
and other common cole crops.)

A biennial (2-year) plant, kale produces leaves in the first year, and then, in the
next year (or sometimes late in the first year), it will form a flower stalk. The
stalk forms flowers and then seeds. Once the seeds mature, the plant dies.

Think beyond grocery store kale; there are so many amazing kale flavors and textures
to choose from if you grow your own seed: mild, almost salad-like greens, sweet ‘Red
Russian’ kales, or the nutty and sometimes peppery flavors of Italian kales, or
handsome ‘Cavalo Nero’ or Tuscan kale, also called dinosaur kale because of
its texture.

As well as being extremely nutritious, kale is attractive, coming in a stunning range
of varieties, from bright greens to dark purples, crunchy leaves to crinkled
beauties, and everything in between. Its ornamental value can be appreciated in
traditional garden beds or containers, especially in the fall.

While easy to grow, there are a few crucial things to get right if you want to enjoy
a truly bumper crop of health-boosting leaves. Read on for our guide to growing kale.

Planting

Full sun and fertile, well-drained soil produce the fastest-growing and most tender
leaves, though kale will tolerate partial shade as well. Add plenty of compost to the
ground before planting and if your soil isn’t especially rich, top up its fertility
by working in nitrogen-rich amendments such as blood meal, cottonseed meal, or
composted manure into the ground before planting.

When to Plant Kale

Kale tastes best when plants grow rapidly and mature before the heat of summer
(before temperatures exceed 75°F/24°C) or after fall frosts occur. Young plants are
not seriously damaged by temperatures down to 25°F/-4°C. Mature plants are extremely
hardy and can withstand very cold temperatures. However, hot temperatures will slow
growth and cause a bitter flavor.

  • For spring: Whether direct seeding into the soil or transplanting start plants
    from the nursery, you can plant 4 to 6 weeks before the average last spring
    frost. Seeds will germinate at soil temperatures as low as 40°F/4°C.
  • For fall: Select early maturing cultivars and direct-seed 3 months before the
    first fall frost date. Note: In areas with hot summers, you’ll need to delay
    sowing until temperatures start to cool off. The cool fall weather really brings
    out the sweet, nutty flavor of kale which can withstand hard frosts (25–28°F)
    without experiencing damage. 
  • Kale can also be grown as a winter vegetable under cover or outside in mild
    winter regions, like the Southwest, Pacific Northwest, and Southeast. They’ll
    grow and yield all winter long. We suggest speaking to your local cooperative
    extension to determine if/when you should plant winter vegetables.

How to Plant Kale

  • When planting, add fertilizer (1-1/2 cups of 5-10-10 fertilizer per 25 feet of
    row) into the top 3 to 4 inches of soil. If you fertilize with compost, apply no
    more than 1 inch of well-composted organic matter per 100 square feet of
    garden area.
  • Plant seeds 1/4 to 1/2 of an inch deep, 1 inch apart, in rows 18 to 30
    inches apart.
  • If you’re setting out young plants (transplants), plant them at the depth at
    which they are growing in the container, spaced 12 inches apart, in rows 18 to 30
    inches apart.
  • After planting, water the plants well.

Growing

  • After about 2 weeks, thin seedlings to 8 to 12 inches apart.
  • It’s important to keep kale well watered and fertilized. If rain is inconsistent,
    provide 1 to 1.5 inches of water each week (about 1 gallon per square foot). 
  • Side-dress as needed with a high-nitrogen fertilizer.
  • Mulch the soil to keep down the weeds, retain moisture, and keep kale cool. Kale
    growth can slow if plants are stressed (too hot or cold, inadequate water, pests
    or disease). 
  • To guarantee a supply of mature leaves through winter, mulch heavily after the
    first hard freeze.

Types

  • ‘Red Russian’ (or ‘Russian Red’):  heirloom; oak leaf-shape, gray-green leaves
    with deep-purple veins and stem; an early crop
  • ‘Lacinato’ (aka ‘Lacinato Blue’, ‘Tuscan’, ‘Black Palm Tree’, or ‘Cavil Nero’):
    heirloom, straplike leaves up to 2 feet long on plants that resemble small palm
    trees; heat tolerant and very cold-hardy.
  • ‘True Siberian’: large, frilly, blue-green leaves; cold-hardy; pick all winter in
    some areas
  • ‘Vates Blue Curled’: hardy variety that is slow to bolt and does not yellow in
    cold weather. It eponymous leaves reach 12 to 14 inches on 15-inch plants
  • ‘Winterbor’: resembles ‘Vates’, with 24-inch leaves on 2- to 3-foot-tall plants;
    baby leaves can be harvested at 28 days; frost-tolerant

Harvesting

  • Kale is ready to harvest when the leaves are about the size of your hand. Pick
    about a fistful of outer leaves per harvest, but no more than one-third of the
    plant at one time.
  • Avoid picking the terminal bud (at the top center of the plant), which helps to
    maintain the plant’s productivity.
  • Kale will continue growing until temperatures reach 20°F/-7°C. Do not stop
    harvesting: A “kiss” of frost makes it even sweeter. (See local frost dates.)
  • To extend the harvest, protect with row covers or tarps. Or, create a makeshift
    cover of old blankets propped up by hay bales.

Wit and Wisdom

  • Kale is not native to North America. Current varieties are descended from
    wild cabbage.
  • Farmers have long grown kale as fodder for farm animals, including cattle
    and sheep.
  • Kale has a number of health benefits, as it is rich in minerals and vitamins A
    and C.
  • To avoid pest and disease issues, do not plant kale or other cole crops in the
    same location more than once every 3 or 4 years.
  • The chill of a moderate frost or light snow improves the flavor of kale.

Cooking Notes

The small, tender leaves can also be added raw to salads or smoothies. Cut and cook
the larger leaves like spinach, but be sure to remove the tough ribs before steaming
or stir-frying. Kale can also be substituted for spinach in omelets, casseroles, and
quesadillas. Enjoy our best kale recipes.

If you find the taste of raw kale to be too bitter, try giving it a massage. Remove
stems and then chop leaves into pieces. Add a small amount of lemon juice or olive
oil, then use your fingers to rub the leaves together for several minutes until the
kale begins to wilt.

Also, kale is great for freezing. See how to freeze kale and other greens.

Hey I didnt see anything about the zones, is it able to grow in 9a - 9b? I've grown
kale here successfully, but I am now selling it and wanted to know if there was
anything I could show people that proves it grows in 9a - 9b we very rarely get below
25 degrees here so it can live throughout the winter.

Hi Ruben,

Kale is a cool weather crop so it is best grown in early spring and in the fall when
the temperatures are cooler in those zones. It can certainly be grown in your area,
and while it prefers full sun, if it will be growing during the warmer times of the
year, it is best to plant in an area that receives shade and make sure to give it
plenty of water.

You can plant kale seeds indoors in late winter, then transplant the seedlings into
the garden in early spring to then enjoy the harvest before the temperatures really
begin to rise. You can also plant in very late summer or early fall so it will be
growing during cooler times.

Hope this helps!

I recently learned kale can cause bowel obstruction in certain people, extremely
painful and requiring surgery, probably shouldn’t go kale crazy 😬

Hello,

I understand your concern, kale is very high in fiber which can cause certain health
problems with certain people but, Kale to most people can be a very nutritious and
might I say delicious snack.

I dry kale in my dehydrator, blend it into powder and use it in my smoothies.

I have several kale plants in a raised bed that have been growing and producing for 3
years. The main stalks are very long and I would like to cut them back. When is the
best time of year to do this?

Thank you.

Bought some grocery store kale. Didn't care for it. Planted some in my garden last
year. Didn't care for that either. I have concluded that I don't care for kale.

Mix it in a salad with baby spinach. Adds depth to the flavor without the bitterness
of kale. And, as a side note, kale and spinach each add a different combination of
nutrition so the compliment each other well.

Most greens in the grocery store are picked when they are past their preferred leaf
size. This makes them taste much stronger than if they were harvested at a smaller,
more flavorful size. Also, different varieties have milder flavors. Try eating your
greens on a peanut butter sandwich made with your favorite whole grain bread &
butter. Very tasty!
