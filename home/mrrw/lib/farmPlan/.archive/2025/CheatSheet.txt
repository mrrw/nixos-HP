Here's a crude cheat sheet for the year's planting.  NOTE, there's probably better ways to make things happen, but this document outlines a (probably) acceptable base plan.

WORK IN PROGRESS
Here's a raw alphabetical list of crops.  As we process this list,
reorganize by date planted.

	YEAR PLAN

January:  Time for planting garlic, pawpaws, apple seeds, and blueberry stems.  Put em
in pots, and potting soil.  Blueberries should be kept indoors in indirect sun.  Pawpaw
and apple seeds need to be cold stratified, so direct seed or plant in pots outdoors.
Garlic needs to be cold stratafied as well.

February:  Before we can plant anything, we need to prep the land.  This means, as much
as possible two things:  1) clearing and tilling land for grain; and 2) building raised
beds.  Take advantage of every warm day to do this work, as there's no time to lose!

March:  Now's the time to start growing early crops in flats.  This includes
bokchoy, cabbage, kale, melon, okra, tomtillo, and tomato.  If indoor space is limited,
which it will be, kale and cabbage can be direct-seeded in spring.
Do one round of planting every two weeks through April.

April:  As soon as the ground is workable, we need to direct seed our spring grains:
barley, oats, rye, and wheat.  This is going to be a lot of work, especially if you
didn't get the chance to clear and till the land in the late winter.  Once the grain is
in, it's time to direct-seed our other early crops including beets, carrots, cabbage &
kale, peas, radishes, salsify, swiss chard, and turnips.
Start another round of flats when you're done, and keep building raised beds.

May: Once the last chance of frost has passed, direct-seed your late spring crops:
beans, sweet corn, cukes, gourds, potato, rice, and sunflower.  Start getting those
flats into the raised beds!  Get yourself ready to attend the farmers' market, and get
foraging.

June:  Time to direct seed squash and burdock.  Don't stop planting out those flats and 
building raised beds.  Start firing the pottery and smoking the meat, and bring whatever
you have to every farmers market.

July:  Harvest your spring grains and plant your millet.  This is also prime outdoor
season in general, so get building, hiking, and camping!

August:  Direct seed your rutabegas.  You could also direct seed a round of fall crops
as your raised beds empty out.

	SEEDS FOR NEXT YEAR
Easy seeds:
Peppers, melons, curcibits, gourds, legumes, grains.
Tricky biscuits:
Chard, rutabaga, onion, cabbage, carrot, parsnip, salsify, turnip, bok choy, beet, kale.
	The tricky biscuits are all biennal, so 5-10 of each plant should be allowed to live
to flower in their second year.  5-10 will allow for a healthy ammount of genetic
diversity for each variety.  Plants of the same species but of differing varieties
should be isolated or carefully timed to avoid corruption through cross-polination

Annuals:  Radish(?), cabbage.
Biennials:  Onion, carrot, rutabaga, parsnip, turnip, kale, chard, bok choy, beet, sals



Growing indoors:
	Coriander (cilantro) - Coriander is the seed spice, and cilantro is the leaf.
		Start indoors in late spring.  Transplant outdoors in summer (loves heat).
		Keep moist.  Light feeder.  Full sun.
	Cumin - Curry seasoning.
		Soak seed 24 hours before planting in flats to help germinate.
		Start indoors in spring.  Keep seeds damp and warm to germinate.
		Germination takes 2-4 weeks.  Transfer to garden in summer.
		Well-draining soil, full sun.  Keep moist (not too dry or wet).
		Mulch.  Light feeder.
		Add compost tea after flowers form (helps seed development)
		Harvest seed after flowers turn yellow/tan and start to split.
	Fenugreek - Curry seasoning.
		Soak seeds 6-12 hours.  Drain, plant in 6-inch deep pot.
		Well-drained soil.  Keep moist.  Full sun.
	Ginger - Tropical plant requiring heat, humidity, and shade.  Plant the rhizome.
		After soaking rhizome for 24 hours, start indoors in early spring.
		Transplant in summer, bury rhizome 2-3" deep.
		Keep moist after leaves appear.  Mulch 2 inches.
		As it grows, bury new pink growth (like potatoes, new rhizomes will grow).
	Tumeric - gets 3 feet tall!  Tropical plant, like ginger.
		After soaking rhizome for 24 hours, start indoors in early spring.
		When plants are 6-8" tall, transplant into larger pots or garden.
		Harvest when leaves and stem start to turn brown and dry.
