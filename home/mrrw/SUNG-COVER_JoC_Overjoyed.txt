Overjoyed
Jars of Clay, Sep. 16, 1997

You name me.  Who am I
That I should company with something so divine?
Mercy waits, overjoyed
Prospects of finding freeing
Freeing me

[Chorus]
	Love is the thing this time I'm sure
	And I couldn't need you more now
	The way that you saw things were so pure
	Overjoyed

You name me.  Entertain
Thoughts of peace can overcome anything
Mirrors spin wicked tales
Here lies reflections of
Deceptions of

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Missing the me from you you gave to me
Don't like the one I have created today
Crossing nameless from the one I've earned
To be the one the one you gave to me

[Pre-Chorus]
You name me
Name Me
Finding freeing me

[Chorus]
Love is the thing this time I'm sure
And I couldn't need you more now
The way that you saw things were so pure
Overjoyed

[Chorus]
Love is the thing this time I'm sure
And I couldn't need you more now
The way that you saw things were so pure
Overjoyed

[Ending]
Overjoyed
