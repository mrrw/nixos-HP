[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       In the first three forms, copy entries from [1m<tree-ish> [22mto the index. In the
       last form, set the current branch head ([1mHEAD[22m) to [1m<commit>[22m, optionally
       modifying index and working tree to match. The [1m<tree-ish>[22m/[1m<commit> [22mdefaults
       to [1mHEAD [22min all forms.

       [4mgit[24m [4mreset[24m [-q] [<tree-ish>] [--] <pathspec>..., [4mgit[24m [4mreset[24m [-q]
       [--pathspec-from-file=<file> [--pathspec-file-nul]] [<tree-ish>]
           These forms reset the index entries for all paths that match the
           [1m<pathspec> [22mto their state at [1m<tree-ish>[22m. (It does not affect the working
           tree or the current branch.)

           This means that [1mgit reset <pathspec> [22mis the opposite of [1mgit add[0m
           [1m<pathspec>[22m. This command is equivalent to [1mgit restore[0m
           [1m[--source=<tree-ish>] --staged <pathspec>...[22m.

           After running [1mgit reset <pathspec> [22mto update the index entry, you can use
           [1mgit-restore[22m(1) to check the contents out of the index to the working
           tree. Alternatively, using [1mgit-restore[22m(1) and specifying a commit with
           [1m--source[22m, you can copy the contents of a path out of a commit to the
           index and to the working tree in one go.

       [4mgit[24m [4mreset[24m (--patch | -p) [<tree-ish>] [--] [<pathspec>...]
           Interactively select hunks in the difference between the index and
           [1m<tree-ish> [22m(defaults to [1mHEAD[22m). The chosen hunks are applied in reverse to
           the index.

           This means that [1mgit reset -p [22mis the opposite of [1mgit add -p[22m, i.e. you can
           use it to selectively reset hunks. See the “Interactive Mode” section of
           [1mgit-add[22m(1) to learn how to operate the [1m--patch [22mmode.

       [4mgit[24m [4mreset[24m [<mode>] [<commit>]
           This form resets the current branch head to [1m<commit> [22mand possibly updates
           the index (resetting it to the tree of [1m<commit>[22m) and the working tree
           depending on [1m<mode>[22m. Before the operation, [1mORIG_HEAD [22mis set to the tip of
           the current branch. If [1m<mode> [22mis omitted, defaults to [1m--mixed[22m. The [1m<mode>[0m
           must be one of the following:

           --soft
               Does not touch the index file or the working tree at all (but resets
               the head to [1m<commit>[22m, just like all modes do). This leaves all your
               changed files "Changes to be committed", as [1mgit status [22mwould put it.

           --mixed
               Resets the index but not the working tree (i.e., the changed files
               are preserved but not marked for commit) and reports what has not
               been updated. This is the default action.

               If [1m-N [22mis specified, removed paths are marked as intent-to-add (see
               [1mgit-add[22m(1)).

           --hard
               Resets the index and working tree. Any changes to tracked files in
               the working tree since [1m<commit> [22mare discarded. Any untracked files or
               directories in the way of writing any tracked files are simply
               deleted.

           --merge
               Resets the index and updates the files in the working tree that are
               different between [1m<commit> [22mand [1mHEAD[22m, but keeps those which are
               different between the index and working tree (i.e. which have changes
               which have not been added). If a file that is different between
               [1m<commit> [22mand the index has unstaged changes, reset is aborted.

               In other words, [1m--merge [22mdoes something like a [1mgit read-tree -u -m[0m
               [1m<commit>[22m, but carries forward unmerged index entries.

           --keep
               Resets index entries and updates files in the working tree that are
               different between [1m<commit> [22mand [1mHEAD[22m. If a file that is different
               between [1m<commit> [22mand [1mHEAD [22mhas local changes, reset is aborted.

           --[no-]recurse-submodules
               When the working tree is updated, using --recurse-submodules will
               also recursively reset the working tree of all active submodules
               according to the commit recorded in the superproject, also setting
               the submodules' HEAD to be detached at that commit.

       See "Reset, restore and revert" in [1mgit[22m(1) for the differences between the
       three commands.

[1mOPTIONS[0m
       -q, --quiet
           Be quiet, only report errors.

       --refresh, --no-refresh
           Refresh the index after a mixed reset. Enabled by default.

       --pathspec-from-file=<file>
           Pathspec is passed in [1m<file> [22minstead of commandline args. If [1m<file> [22mis
           exactly [1m- [22mthen standard input is used. Pathspec elements are separated by
           LF or CR/LF. Pathspec elements can be quoted as explained for the
           configuration variable [1mcore.quotePath [22m(see [1mgit-config[22m(1)). See also
           [1m--pathspec-file-nul [22mand global [1m--literal-pathspecs[22m.

       --pathspec-file-nul
           Only meaningful with [1m--pathspec-from-file[22m. Pathspec elements are
           separated with NUL character and all other characters are taken literally
           (including newlines and quotes).

       --
           Do not interpret any more arguments as options.

       <pathspec>...
           Limits the paths affected by the operation.

            [1m3. [22mHowever, you already dirtied the index (i.e. your index does
               not match the [1mHEAD [22mcommit). But you know the pull you are going
               to make does not affect [1mfrotz.c [22mor [1mfilfre.c[22m, so you revert the
               index changes for these two files. Your changes in working tree
               remain there.
            [1m4. [22mThen you can pull and merge, leaving [1mfrotz.c [22mand [1mfilfre.c[0m
