[Verse 1]
Flies are buzzing 'round my head
Vultures circling the dead
Picking up every last crumb
The big fish eat the little ones
Big fish eat the little ones
Not my problem, give me some

[Chorus]
You can try the best you can
You can try the best you can
The best you can is good enough
You can try the best you can
You can try the best you can
The best you can is good enough

[Verse 2]
This one's optimistic
This one went to market
This one just came out of the swamp
This one drops a payload
Fodder for the animals
Living on an animal farm

[Chorus]
You can try the best you can
You can try the best you can
The best you can is good enough
You can try the best you can
You can try the best you can
The best you can is good enough

[Bridge]
I'd really like to help you, man
I'd really like to help you, man
Nervous messed up marionette
Floating 'round on a prison ship

[Chorus]
You can try the best you can
You can try the best you can
The best you can is good enough
You can try the best you can
You can try the best you can

[Outro]
Dinosaurs roaming the earth
Dinosaurs roaming the earth
Dinosaurs roaming the earth

How to Format Lyrics:

  • Type out all lyrics, even repeating song parts like the chorus
  • Lyrics should be broken down into individual lines
  • Use section headers above different song parts like [Verse], [Chorus], etc.
  • Use italics (<i>lyric</i>) and bold (<b>lyric</b>) to distinguish between
    different vocalists in the same song part
  • If you don’t understand a lyric, use [?]

“Optimistic,” the sixth song on the album, got more radio play than just about every
other track. It seems to feature two potential reactions to the desolation of a
consumerist marketplace. The first verse describes a greedy and exploitative
attitude, while the “optimistic” second verse mentions how “the system” works.

The chorus, though, contains the wisdom or message of the song, which is that the
realization of one’s deontological limits (what one can actually do) CAN lead to a
kind of satisfaction, though perhaps not a cheerful one.
