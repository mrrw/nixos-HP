BACKROOMS WITH DIGDUG: THE PROTOTYPE



It all started at A-Sync Industries, a small furniture and housing company. See, the place was completely harmless, that is until some rando named Ivan Beck showed up.
He was a trouled man who took over the company. When he was a kid, he lived through the...incident, of Karlovy, Vary in 1931. He was traumatized forever. As Buzz Lightyear
would say, he is "one sad little man". 

At some point and became a very smart scientist, who had a plan at A-Sync. He would open a portal that he called the Low-Proximity Magnetic Distortion system, whatever
the hell that means. At least, that was the "scientific" name. He mostly just called it Project the haunting name of Project KV31. Why is it creepy, you ask? Just skim
through the passage and think at the same time. It's not that hard, c'mon! So that's what he did. He built a super crazy scientific portal that pretty much led to
another dimension. He said in the old-fashioned ads that it was to have more storage for our stuff. But he lied. He just wanted to explore. He sent in guys with hazmat
suits to explore this guy's own little funworld. At some point the found muensters, so if they were to eat him, I wonder if they could taste his sadness?
