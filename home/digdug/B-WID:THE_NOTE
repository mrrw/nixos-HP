BACKROOMS WITH DIGDUG: THE NOTE



Dear father, Mrrw...

Hello. It's me, DigDug, your Linux apprentice. 
If you are reading this,

1. That means you cracked the code to my Linux account. Just fantastic. That's breaking and entering, so I'll have to sue you.
2. I love you.
3. I need to tell you something.

Once, my mother had a dream that she was stuck in the poolrooms from the Backrooms.
In her dream, she wished that I was there to help her, because 
she knows how much I knows about the Backrooms. In my opinion, she should've wished 
for Broogli, because he's the big-headed, multiple-eyed friend who I got all that
information  about the Backrooms from.

                                              You're son, DigDug

                P.S.

           I know you were going to do 
         the same thing as me, butt I'm 
            doing it cuz you knows nothing
         about the Backrooms, lol.
                    XD
