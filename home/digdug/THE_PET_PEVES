THE PET PEVES

Ever heard of the house on Gremlin Street?
No?
Then, you might as well live under a rock!

It started the day of June 5th, 1967.
The Licherall Family was trying to get their children to eat their lima beans.
Unfortunately for their nutrition,
The only words the knew how to pronounce were, "No!" and "Shut your butt!"
All they wanted were candy.
The parents ducked into a closet to come up with a plan to healthify those dumb grenlins.
"All they ever do is yell across the house and bounce off the walls!" said Mrs. Licherall.
"And they practicaly explode when they find out we have boiled brocoli for dinner," said Mr. Licherall.
"Wait! I have a plan!" said the mother.

They left the closet to find the lights were out, 
And it was a total wreck.
At some point they heard a rustle
Coming from the parents' room.
"Oh, no," said the parents.
They went upstairs, and Mrs. L
Called, "How many times have I told you kids to stay out of our room!!?"
