ORANGE JUICE



Once, there was a small family,
In a land of blue skies and green grass.
The family consisted of
A father,
A mother,
Two girls,
One boy.
They were just minding their own business,
Drinking some orange juice,
When they heard their doorbell ring.
The father opened the door, but there was nothing, 
Just a watermelon.
"'Tis nothing,"
He said.
Then he heard much screaming, from the kitchen!
He caught a glimpse of his kids screaming
And a strange figure emerging from the carton of juice.
The lights flickered, and it was just him and his wife.
They grabbed the emergency break-action shotgun,
And went upstairs, 
Where the sludgy orange trail led.
There were red handprints on the walls,
And footprints scattered accross the cieling! (little kids sure do bounce off the walls)
It led to the kids' room, where there was 
Footprints,
Handprints,
Legprints,
Armprints,
And even faceprints,
Dotted closely together on every surface.
There was also orange juice splattered everywhere.
The monster then appeared and ate the horrified parents.
That was the end of the missing family.
