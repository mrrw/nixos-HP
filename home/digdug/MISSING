Once Upon a Time...

There was a little boy
Went missing years ago

So many ways for him
To finally go

He could've tryed to fly,
And wouldn't have bounced

No way he found any food,
Not even an ounce

Perhaps he'd attempt
To turn into a fish

But he forgot his gills
Out with a "splish"!

No one knows where
He could possibly be

For all they knew,
He could be at sea

That is no one
Except for me

This was all a scheme
Started by the boy

It spread to
His little siblings, yelling "ahoy"

They made a little flag
Of fabric and wood

Then the little boy
Set off to find the woods
