If I could go anywhere,
My happy place,
It would be a flat plain,
With a smiling sun,
A blue sky, bright green grass,
Going for infinity,
Going out so far, with a veiw so clear,
You can see the surface curve,
With the occasional small cottage, 
For is it truly endless,
Or just a small globe with just one house?

If I could go anywhere,
My happy place,
It would be a children's party building,
So large, so vast,
Nobody else in it,
With yellow wallpaper,
Cartoon characters drawn on the walls,
Long halls,
Many rooms,
Some would have little slides,
Some would have arcade sets,
But most of all, the most see-able thing,
Tables, with drinks, pizza
A colorful tablecloth,
Balloons, 
And a little red velvet cake,
For is it red velvet,
or human flesh?

If I could die anywhere,
My happy place, 
It would be not Earth, 
Not Mars,
But Venus, of all planets,
With it's lovely green skies,
Its flat grounds,
With it's toxic atmosphere,
So the last thing I see,
When I do the sweet, sweet I've wanted, 
For so long,
Is the beautiful landscape of planet Venus,
My happy place.
