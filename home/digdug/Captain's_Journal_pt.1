PROLOGUE




Once Upon a Time,
There were three children,
All related,
Closely related,
A 5-year old girl, Amelia,
A 6-year-old boy, Nathan,
And the eldest, 
The captain,
Benjamin Feleni.

The children were quite mischevous,
Very, super, EXTREMELY mischivous,
As they grew, so did their crimes.
One day, their crimes became so naughty,
They were kicked out of Italy.

AND SO IT BEGAN.



DAY 1
midday

My name is DigDug. I'm 11 years old. This is my first day out in the wilderness of North America. I miss my Mom. I miss my life in Italy. I know the laws here are
different, I just don't know how. I've rebelled against the law, for we are the 3Mice. We live off of society. We feed on society. We don't have a watch, so we just use
the sun to keep track of time. Let's reveiw the status on our camp we call "The Mousenest", shall we?

Okey-dokey, so I assigned my little sister, KitKat, to set up the sleeping bags, my brother, FrikFrak, to build a lil fire pit, and myself, the coolest kid in the 
group, to chop some wood with my hatchet. I got bored, so when I thought that would be enough wood for a fire, I told the others I would go out for a hike.
So here I am in the middle of the woods, just made a map, and writing this.

afternoon

OMG, the craziest thing happened while I was on my mini-hike! After I finished writing the thing, I heard footsteps nearby. Probly like a few...meters? Muh-Miles?
No, no, that doesnt make sense. Probably that first one. Anyhoo, so I looked behind my back away from the nice view I was looking at which had a few pieces of a broken
car and an abandoned house (more on that later) to see a guy with a rifle clearly aiming at something. One thing that gave me a sense of releif was that he wasnt aiming
at ME. Also, he clearly didn't know I was there, so that was another thing. I hid behind a tree. Then dashed to another. And another, and another, and so on. At one
point, I tripped over a rock and swore. But then I looked over to The Guy and just above a whisp, I said, "Uh, oh." The Guy was looking straight at me as if angry at
my vulger toung. Then I ran away screaming, "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH! IM SORRY!!!" I told the other two about it, and then KitKat siad she had a plan. "If we do it just right,
we could get our hands on that old gun!" And I said "No, no, its too dangero-- wait... say that last part again?" "We could get our hands on that one!" She told me her
plan in private. But then I got a better idea. An aweful idea! I got a wonderful, AWEFUL idea! I told her about mine. We agreed.
