PROLOGUE




Once Upon a Time,
There were three children,
All related,
Closely related,
A 5-year old girl, Amelia,
A 6-year-old boy, Nathan,
And the eldest, 
The captain,
Benjamin Feleni.

The children were quite mischevous,
Very, super, EXTREMELY mischivous,
As they grew, so did their crimes.
One day, their crimes became so naughty,
They were kicked out of Italy.

AND SO IT BEGAN.



DAY 1
midday

My name is DigDug. I'm 11 years old. This is my first day out in the wilderness of North America. I miss my Mom. I miss my life in Italy. I know the laws here are
different, I just don't know how. I've rebelled against the law, for we are the 3Mice. We live off of society. We feed on society. We don't have a watch, so we just use
the sun to keep track of time. Let's reveiw the status on our camp we call "The Mousenest", shall we?

Okey-dokey, so I assigned my little sister, KitKat, to set up the sleeping bags, my brother, FrikFrak, to build a lil fire pit, and myself, the coolest kid in the 
group, to chop some wood with my hatchet. I got bored, so when I thought that would be enough wood for a fire, I told the others I would go out for a hike.
So here I am in the middle of the woods, just made a map, and writing this.

afternoon

OMG, the craziest thing happened while I was on my mini-hike! After I finished writing the thing, I heard footsteps nearby. Probly like a few...meters? Muh-Miles?
No, no, that doesnt make sense. Probably that first one. Anyhoo, so I looked behind my back away from the nice view I was looking at which had a few pieces of a broken
car and an abandoned house (more on that later) to see a guy with a rifle clearly aiming at something. One thing that gave me a sense of releif was that he wasnt aiming
at ME. Also, he clearly didn't know I was there, so that was another thing. I hid behind a tree. Then dashed to another. And another, and another, and so on. At one
point, I tripped over a rock and swore. But then I looked over to The Guy and just above a whisp, I said, "Uh, oh." The Guy was looking straight at me as if angry at
my vulger toung. Then I ran away screaming, "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH! IM SORRY!!!" I told the other two about it, and then KitKat siad she had a plan. "If we do it just right,
we could get our hands on that old gun!" And I said "No, no, its too dangero-- wait... say that last part again?" "We could get our hands on that one!" She told me her
plan in private. But then I got a better idea. An aweful idea! I got a wonderful, AWEFUL idea! I told her about mine. We agreed.

There we were, sharpening our "spears" which were actualy just hiking sticks with sharp parts at the end. We packed some rope, a surprise diistraction,
and a banana for scale in case we found something big, and a cap gun. Once we put on our backpacks, smeared ourselves with mud and grass for camoflauge, we were off!
After like fifteen minutes, we began get worried. What if The Guy had already left? But then we heard a very loud sound that we will never forget, a defening "BANG!!"
that made us all fall over. "Yep, he's definitely nearby," I said. Then we saw The Guy. We went into a tree all at once. The ol' hunter waited and listened. Waited to
see his pray and shoot. So did we, waiting for an okay time to strike. At some point, FrikFrak let a big one rip, and I mean a BIG one, echoing across the vast forest.
It STANK too. "FRIKFRAK!" I scolded him not much more than a whisp. "Oops, sorry. Must've been the soup," he whispered back. The Guy clearly heard it. He was looking 
around in our direction, but I don't think he saw us. The camo...it worked! I thought, releived. I was still scared so I opened my backpack and got out a little box
rapped with ribbon. "The surprise distraction," I whisped. I threw it across the woods. It bounced off a rock in our oposite direction, making a loud "plop" sound.
Jackpot! I thought. The Guy picked it up and opened it. I was thrilled, sweat pouring down my face. A million frogs jumpeed out! I got out the rope and tied it to a
branch. Then I tied the other end to the not-sharp part of my sick. "I'm gonna throw this to make a zipline. You guys use your sticks to slide down," I said to the 
others. I threw the stick. I watched the others slide down, as planned. I jumped out of the tree and snuck behind the other two, dashing from tree to tree. Then the 
Guy turned around to see FrikFrak and KitKat standing there, smiling in a silly way. "Awww, look at you two," the Guy said. "You and your boyfriend are so cute 
together!" "This is my brother," KitKat said. "Oh. My mistake." Then I jumped out from behind a tree, aiming my cap gun, a little blue revolver. "GIVE US ALL YOUR STUFF!"
I shreiked, pointing my cap gun at the guy. "You," The Guy said. "Me," I replied. I pulled the trigger, and a sort of "POP" sound came out. I got him in the forehead, 
though I was aiming for his boing-loings. "Gotta work on that," I said to myself. He screamed in rage. "You little--" he tried to say, but I cut him off saying, 
"Sorry, gotta go!" 

We ran, hearing banging sounds, yeallow-orange streaks flying by. There was a pause and a crinkly sound every four shots. We ran down some hill, the same one from 
earlier, and we tripped and fell. Thankfully, we landed in a bush, so The Guy couldn't see us. We could still hear him walking, searching for the little thieves. 
We snuck out of the bush, but then I saw that KitKat was limping. "You good?" I said. "Ow, my leg!" she said, clearly in pain. "I think there's some medical supplies
back at the Mousenest," I told her. "C'mon. Let's head back." I got out my map, and we all went in the camp's direction. But then, we heard the Guy grunting. I cringed.
We tried to sneak over to that abandoned house from earlier, but that silly old FrikFrak stepped on a branch. "REALLY!?" Me and KitKat said at the same time. "Sorry"
replied FrikFrak. "There's no apology. You've killed us all!" "I SAID SORRY!!" The Guy turned and saw us. A smile spread accross his face. "I've got ya now!" 

"Now you've done it!" I said, scolding my brother. We had to carry KitKat, slowing us down. Thankfully, I realized that the Guy wasn't really aiming at us. He was 
probably just trying to scare us out of the woods. I threw KitKat into the window of the abandoned house. "Use your rope!" I called to her. She threw it down so we 
could climb up. The Guy broke down the rotten door, so we hid behind a rocking chair, shivering. He slowly got closer. My mind was racing. "Wait...the banana!" I said. 
I got out the big, yellow berry and threw it off the edge of the loft. The Guy heard it. But he wasn't an idiot! He found out where it came from and walked up the rotten
stairs. We heard creaking sounds, and the wooden floor bent and snapped. Suddenly, the loft broke, and all of us, including the Guy fell. There was a big, scary spider
next to him. He took one look at it and screamed for at least four seconds and passed out...or did he...DIE!? "He must've had a heart attack!" FrikFrak said. 
"Ooowwwww, my leg!" KitKat said. Then we went back to the Mousenest.

Right now, it's Darkness and Im writing in my journal cuz Im bored. Once we got back to the Mousenest, we bandaged KitKat's leg and had soup from a thermos for dinner.
We took turns dinking from the small thermos. It was a pretty weird day overall. I'm sure it will be a great life in the woods, three children protecting eachother from
the world!
3MICE ARE LIKE ROCKS


DAY 2
morning

"Breaky time!" I said, opening a microwavable egg pouch I stole from some old lady a few months before. "It's probably expired, but it'll all be worth it when we fill our
dump trucks!" "But we don't have a microwave," said KitKat, still wearing the bandage. "Duh!" I said, pointing at the unlit fire. KitKat rolled her eyes. I tied the 
egg pouch to a stick and held it over the fire. Then I accidentily dropped it. "NOOOOOOOOO!!! OUR BREAKY!!" we all screamed at once. Thankfuly, FrikFrak saved the day
by shoving it out of the fire with a stick. Some were raw, some were burned, and only one was just right. We fought over it, but my lil brother saved the day yet again
by saying, "C'mon, guys, isn't the solution obvious?" Then he cut it up into thirds with my hatchet. "Where did you get that?" I asked. "Your belt," he replied.
"Just ask permision next time, okay?" 

midday

After like half an hour of forcing ourselves and each other to eat raw or burned eggs and overripe apples, it started to rain. We were like, "AHHH! ALL OUR  STUFFS!!" 
so we filled our sleeping bags with all our bags and belongings and carried them over our heads. Then we got out our emergency blankets and hiking sticks to make  
temporary tents. It must've been at leat three hours since it happened. It's still raining, too. We made our tents sort of face each other so that we could pass notes.
But then it rained so hard, our notes decintigrated as soon as they touch the outside. 

afernoon

I can't beleive it's still raining. It's been hours! I can't take it anymore! But a few minutes ago, it started to hail, so it's REALLY not worth the pain. Good thing 
we all have emergency lighters to keep us warm, otherwise one of us could loose a toe or two. It's starting to get pretty windy, and I'm starting to get worried.

sunset

THIS SUCKS. I'm starting to get extremely worried. It's getting really windy, and I'm seeing some thunder, and it's loud, and it's also loud as thundy, also I see 
lightning, and it's loud and loud.

darkness...!?

...how...

DAY ???
morning...?

Woah. Okay, I knew this would be a crazy life, but what I DIDN'T expect was a super crazy storm! I woke up with a headache and my ribs hurt, and my back hurts, and my
shoulder hurts, and my neck hurts. The last thing I remember before I woke up, like an hour after my previous entry, the wind somehow got EVEN MORE INTENSE. Then my tent
started collapsing. Then it got blown away! Then I got blown away!! Then I realised I also got seperated from the others. Next thing I know, I hit my head on a rock, and
it was lights out for me. So here I am, in the middle of the woods, with no shelter and I have no idea where I am. 

I think it's only been like a day? Maybe three? Who knows, who cares. All I want to focus on is trying to not starve. Wait...are there BEARS in this area? I really
hope there aren't bears. 

sunset.

I can't do this.



A FEW WEEKS LATER
midday

Okay, so here's what I've lost over them mouse years: shoes, socks, cap gun, some hair, my shirt, several toes, an entire fingernail, my location, and part of my toungue.
I've been eating random berries, and I think that's going to come back to haunt me. I feel sick. But I also feel strong like nobody's buisiness. I got hurt a lot, some of
my toes fell off from frostbite, and I accidently bit part of my toungue off in a fight with a pack of wolves. I fended most of them off with my hatchet, but when I found
out one of them lingered, I used them as a nice warm jacket, and cooked their insides over a fire. I found a pond nearby, so at least I've got someplace to refill my 
water bottle. When I looked at my reflection in the water, I realised I had a broken nose and lots of cuts and broozes. "THAT'S why my nose still hurts!" I laughed.

afternoon

Today, something happened...a maricle. I heard voices in the distance, and I actually recognised them! But I thought I was just going crazy, since I was so lonely for so
long. But then I heard it again, and I got ANGRY. "OH, SHUT UP!" I yelled. "I've had enough of these woods, and more than enough of soul-crippling loneliness!!" But then
I heard it again, this time closer, and I was scared now. "Oh...oh, no!" I said, in my shivery voice. "I-I'm going insane! THIS IS THE END!!" I'd never been this scared.
My life was crumbling all around me. I could see hallucinations. I saw swirls of darkness, there was random smiley faces, and for some reason, everything had the glitch
effect. At some point, all my worst enimies from school like, came out of the ground, and their stupid heads turned into lemons, and they started saying "ALL YOUR FAULT!"
while pointing at me. Then all my classmates appeared and they all started laghing at me. Then a dark hand came out of the shadows and reached for me. Then the trees 
all caught on fire, and I heard explosions. Then, I fell onto the ground and all I saw was a monkey putting it's finger on its lip and saying "Shhhhhhhh..." Then I woke
up in outer space on a sort of platform, and some guy made of ice cream was standing in front of me, eating himself with a spoon made of teeth. He said, "Ice cream will 
make you feel better :)" Then I said, "What!?" Then a flame thrower appeared and was throwng flames at the guy made of ice cream, who was screaming as he slowly melted.
Then my ex-girlfriend appeared and was saying bull crap like, "You never liked me." Sure, I don't like her anymore, but still. Then she turned into popcorn, and a million
mice came and started eating it. "Hey, stop that!" I said. But then they fused together into one big wave of mice.Then, a spooky version of myself appeared. Pale skin,
grey hoodie, and the most noticable feature, a dark purple top hat. Something about that hat was...off. Then the platform shattered and I fell, and landed in a subway
staion. Some stranger was walking by, and the wave of mice trampled him over, and what was left of him was a pile of mushy red pulp, eaten by the mice. And I was next!
They ran toward me, so I dodged them by jumping onto the train tracks. But then a train cam and ran me over.
