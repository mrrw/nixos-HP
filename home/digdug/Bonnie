BONNIE

You've heard the stories,
You've read the files,
Of caves full of blood
And child piles
The lair of the beast
With razor-fangs,
The monster we like to call--

Bonnie, Bonnie,
Bonnie, Bonnie

Faster than a bullet,
Vision like a sniper,
Venom stronger than the bite of a viper

She-okay, we get it.
