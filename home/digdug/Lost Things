3MICE: MOUSENEST 2023

A sort of city, built with stolen things. Little lost things. A wall of cob and wood protects it from those dumbass cops. Protects us. 
We are the 3Mice, a tribe of children and young adults. Nameless children. Many with creative nicknames, bred into crime. Bred into the 3Mice.
This is our home, built out of stolen things. Little lost things, with buildings of scrap metal and sheets of wood stolen from Loes, labeled with spraypaint 
and stolen neon signs. Outside is a forest. Invisible tree forts for ambushing, cuz we don't like human society. We mug any foolish hiker we see, knocking them
out and kidnapping them to cook them. This is how we survive. We are the 3Mice. This is how the 2023 cronicle begins.

They walk along, other citizens wake up.
