PROLOGUE




Once Upon a Time,
There were three children,
All related,
Closely related,
A 5-year old girl, Amelia,
A 6-year-old boy, Nathan,
And the eldest, 
The captain,
Benjamin Feleni.

The children were quite mischevous,
Very, super, EXTREMELY mischivous,
As they grew, so did their crimes.
One day, their crimes became so naughty
