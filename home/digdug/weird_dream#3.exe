DigDug in Wonderland

One time, I was on the couch, texing my friend, Carrot, and I got really tired. Then I accidentily dropped the phone on my face, and started raging out. For some reason,
the phone turned into Pal from the movie Mitchels VS Machines. You should watch it. Anyway, she said something like, "Wanna play Block Blast?" and for some reason, that 
made me freak out. I thew the phone, and it exploded. I sure felt better after that. Then a sort of plague doctor with a fork for oone hand and a spoon for the other
hand appeared. He had several "questionable" stains on his robe, and the eyeholes had mushrooms growing out of them. "Good evening, child," said he, even though it was 
like 10:30am. I asked him about the stains, and he said, "Oh, these jewels? This one's pasta sauce, this one is mustard, and I got this one from science class." 
"And what about that one?" I asked, pointing at a big grey one. "Oh, I can't tell you that," he said in a low voice. "Why not?" "Oh, you wouldn't understand. You're too
YOOOOOOOOUUUUUUUUUNNG!!!" I got very anxious, the kind of fear you would get in a dream. When he said young, his beak lifted up, revealing what looked like the mouth of
a goblin shark. I no-clipped through the floor, into the backrooms.

I felt the wet, smelly carpet on my face. I looked around at the yellow walls and realized where I was. I walked around for a while, walked through the endless maze.
It took me a minute to realize that it was actually getting slightly different as I went on. The wall colors began to change, the carpet seemed to dry, and the lights
flickered more and more. At one point, the tiled cieling was replaced by one of those fake sky-looking ones, the ground was covered with fake grass, the only lights 
were the cloud-shaped ones on the cieling, and the walls resembled plains amd forests. I found a door that looked like the sun, and opened it. Inside was a sort of mall
with the same ceilings but much higher, the ground looked like streets, and there were miniature BUILDINGS on the walls! I glanced at the building labeled "Popular Mall
Food" and my stomach grumbled. It looked dark and closed, as did the other fake but realistic builidings. I tried the door, but it was locked. I heard a strange, distant
noise. It sounded like a combination of scraping, screaming, and roaring. I looked behind me to see one of those sewer lids, but it was marked "Employees Only". I went
inside to find what looked like a workspace...for employees, obviously. I found a crowbarand took it. I didn't know at the time, but I could feel myself grinning. I went
back up to the mall restraunt. I went up to the glass door, my crowbar squeezed tightly in my hand. I quietly cackled. "I've wanted to do something like this for a long
time," I said, trying not to yell. I lifted up the crowbar and smashed the door, peices of glass flying everywhere. I went inside. I couldn't hold it in. I screamed out,
"EVERYBODY ON THE FLOOR! THIS IS A STICKUP!!!" It was dark, so I turned on the lights, and it immediately looked open. I glanced at the cash register on the front desk.
My enthusiastic grin begame a maniacle smile. I raised my crowbar and swung at the C-R, but right before it hit it, some creepy figure popped up from behind the front 
desk and said, "ALLO, MITE, WHOT EES YOUR ORDER!?" I screamed in terror and shock, and my crowbar just barely touched the cash thing.

The thing that appeared was a sort of broomstick lady with licorice for arms and an apron. Her head was a Happy Meal and her hair was..."My old tiger costume?" I said,
surprised. "WHOT?" she asked. "Your hair is my tiger shirt from when I was little." "WHOT? BOI, I'M SURE THERE'S BEEN A MEESOONDERSTANDING. THEES EES HAIR." "No, that's
my tiger shirt from when I was like...*does math in head*...3 years old."  "I SURE DON SEE ANY TOIGER COSTUME, BUT ADMIRE MY BEAUTIFUL RED HAIR!" "No, that's my shirt."
"BOI, ARE YOU SKITZNEFRINTIC?" "Well, now that you mention it, I--" "ALLO, MITE, WHAT EES YOUR ORDER!?" I still can't beleive she forgot what we were talking about.
I just smiled and said, "I'll take a BigMac," then she said, "WE DON SALE BIGMACS HERE, LEETOL GORL." Unsurprisingly, her face turned into Gru from Dispicable Me when she
said "gorl". Then I said, "What? I'm not a girl, I'm a--" She interupted me AGAIN by saying, "WE DON SALE BIGMACS HERE, LEETOL GORL." "Well, then what do you sell?" I 
asked. Her smiling Gru face slowly turned into a sad frown. "Nothing," she said. This was the first thing she said that wasn't typed in all caps. She started tearing up.
"Are you okay?" I asked. "I'm terrible at business. Terrible!" she replied, crying now. "It's all just a scam. Leave my resteraunt now, before you become a scammer!"
"What??" "It's just a scam, boy! Look, I can prove it. Really!" She led me to a sort of janitor's closet and opened the door with her licorice arm. A bunch of stuff ex-
ploded out like a tsunami. Out of the pile of junk, she pulled out a dusty sheet of paper. "Look!!" she exclaimed, shoving it in my face. I told her I couldn't read it
because it was covered with dust. Then she blew the dust off and shoved it into my face once more. It said...

LIST OF EMPLOYEE RULES

1- Lure people in with inviting accent

2- Jumpscare robbers so they run away

3- Make sure they pay before you give them NOTHING! Ha!


I opened my mouth to say something, but she just burst into tears. I slowly left the resteraunt.

I heard that same scraping sound from earlier. I looked behind me and all the lights in the restaraunt went out. Something was chasing me, a dream demon with pale skin,
blank eyes, colorful spikes on its head, and no mouth. I ducked into the sewer lid and found a lever-action rifle where the crowbar was. I used it to shoot the demon, 
making it explode into popcorn. I realized that was its only shot, so I looked back at the spot where I picked up the gun to see if there was an amo box or something, but
there was just a note that said, "Did you think it'd be that easy?" I put the gun around my back just in case. I found an "Employees Only" door, so I went in.

It opened up to a WEAPONERY. I took everything I needed. Ammo boxes, grenades, and...nothing else. I found another door and reached for a handle, but then everything went
black, and my weapons disappeared. Another thing appeared. This new thing looked like a Partygoer from the Backrooms disguised as a Partypooper. It also had a very long 
nose that looked like a gun. "You can't hide, George," he said in a scratchy, low voice. I opened my mouth to tell'em my real name, but nothing came out. I tried to put
some distance, but my feet were rooted to the floor. The Thing's Partygoer smile turned even more wide. I tried to draw my rifle, but I forgot it disapeared. He very, 
very, VERY slowly placed a bullet into his gun nose and EVEN MORE SLOWLY drew back the bolt. A drop of cold sweat rolled down my cheek, and then my side felt like I was
lying on a cold, wet bed. I think this was because I was sweating in real life. Then it started to rain. The Thing stepped forward. He said, "Soon you shall become a
scammer too, and my client will GET BACK TO WORK!!" I thunk, "The Broomstick's boss!" It stepped forward again. He turned off the safety on his gun nose. BLAM! I saw it
like in slow motion. I fell over, just before the bullet flew past my face. The Thing, still smiling, seemed to be quite frusterated. "Ahh, I see you have mastered the 
arts of lucid dreaming. But you still have no power. You can only move and SCREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM!!!!" When he said "scream", it came out like a little
girl's shreak of fear. This startled and annoyed me, so I said, "Son of a--" BLAM! The bullet went right through my chest. I heard the Thing laugh as I melt into salsa.
I could taste it too. Next thing I knew, I was back in the weaponery with all my grenades, but I couldn't find my rifle.

Angry about this, I see'd what I could find. I picked out the dual pistols and used the sticker bomb gun skin. I opened the door to a village of little eyeball people.
