DOORS (the dream)




One time, I had a really scary dream where I just got done taking a shower. Then, when I went to the hallway, something was off. It looked darker, all the doors were 
locked even though most of them don't even HAVE locks. I also noticed that the hallway looked a bit longer and it was quiet. TOO quiet. I went downstairs, and instead
of finding a "fork" in the path, (left: a toy box. right: the rest of the house) I found a spooky-cool black door with an open-mouthed skull engraved on it. In its
mouth was a video tape note that said in all caps written in blood, "THIS FOOTAGE IS THE KEY TO ALL UNDERSTANDING". There was a sign above the skull on the door that
said "the basement" and I was like, "Huh? This house can't be that small." I opened the door anyway because some sort of dream fear prevented me from going upstairs.

The door led me to some nostalgic-looking basement stair, which led to the same door but with no note. That door led me to the same door over and over until it led me
to a different door. It was an old, warped version of the skull door, but the skull was a REAL skull. The sign said, "UNBEARABLE TEMPTATION". I didn't want to open it,
but I heard something coming from up the stairs. I looked back at the door, but the sign now said, "YOUR BROTHER'S HUNGIE". I looked back, and sure enough, there was a
weird-looking criptid thing on all fours running at me. I burst through the creepy door and went inside. All I saw was those same stairs but no walls. Just blackness. 
I went down them, and I thought I heard whispering. But now there was door shaped like a heart. A pink one that wasn't ominous. The only weird thing was a sign that said
"i told you." I think it was refering to the sign that said "unbearable temptation"? 

Inside was something that terrified. MY FIRST CRUSH. Trust me, she looks hot, but you do NOT want to try to date her. She's the kind of crush that could break your 
heart, or maybe your arms. She was having what she called a "girls-only slumberparty". I was pretty mad about that, because I HATE girls-only things. But I didn't rage
because this was my crush I was dealing with along with several other crushes, including Kelsie and Bella. Kelsie's (almost) perfect, Bella is 9 and I'm 12. But Bella
likes me, and she doesn't know, but I think I like her back. Gracie, my first crush, said that I'm accepted into the party. I wasn't happy about that, because the only
songs playing were Taylor Swift songs and songs like Hot-To-Go. I HATE Hot-To-Go. It gives me migrains. But, again, these are my crushes, so I accepted the invitation.
Since Bella's the one who liked me back, I tried talking to her. She looked at me with a strange look in her eyes. Her eyes looked like the moon. But since it was a 
dream, I didn't care. "Like where this is going," I said. We got closer together, and I liked where this was going.

But right when I thought we would kiss, my brain referenced Adventure Time, and not in a good way. She said in that monster-like deep voice if you know what I mean,
"YOU RUN IN THE PATH OF MY LIGHT" Then I said, "Oh-kaaaaaay..." Then she was like, "HOW CAN YOU LEAVE ME WHEN I AM YOUR GUIDE?" "No!!!!" She started laughing, and 
everything changed. My other crushes disappeared into thin air. The room morphed into a dark forest and Bella turned into the Moon from Adventure Time. I tried to run,
but it's hard to run when your dreaming. Somehow, I no-clipped through the floor into a liminal space.

It was a large-ish square room with a tiled cieling, gray carpet, and skin-tone walls. There were doors with strange locks everywhere. The most noticable door was a
green double-door, and it had the most locks. The only ones without locks were small trapdoors. For some reason, I began to focus on the blue one that didn't seem have a
lock. I walked over to try to open it, but it was locked after all. But this one was locked normally. I opened a red cupboard door
