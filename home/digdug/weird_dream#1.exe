Bullets and Magic

Once, I had a dream where I'm just minding my own bussiness, walking home from my bus stop, when this guy in a Cyber Truck appears out of nowhere and kidnaps me.
He had this mask that looked like a combination of Lord Voldemort and the guy from The Shining. Next thing I know, I was tied to a chair in his basement. There were a 
whole bunch of other guys with similar masks. I remember one that looked like a combination of Donald Trump and Donald Duck and one that looked like a combination of 
Amethest from Steven Universe and White Diamond. From Steven Universe. Anyway, the guy who kidnapped me said something along the lines of, "Be not afaid, young 
businessman, for you shall go to Hogwarts! Your a wizard, DigDug!" Then I said, "But I'm just Harry," "Well, Just Harry," said the guy. "You're a wizard, so go to
Hogwarts or your family will go bankrupt and turn into donuts!" 

Then my brain skipped ahead to where they LITERALLY threw me out of their Cyber Truck into the train station. When I tried to go to Platform 9 3/4, instead of going to
Platform 9 3/4, I went to the Backrooms where there were all these confused-looking wizard kids. From that point on, I played the role of Ron Weasly. Somehow, the
Hogwarts Express pulled up, and we all got on. Everyhing that happened in Harry Potter happened on the train, except I saw through Ron's eyes. We went to this, like,
liminalcore/dreamcore version of Hogwarts. (as if it weren't already those things!) Before we did the Sorting Cerimony, Professor Dumbledore told us why Hogwarts is
suddenly a liminal space. He said that over the summer, a rift zone opened up directly under Hogwarts, and the entire castle, employees and all, no-clipped into the 
Backrooms, so now we had to live in the Backrooms. Then we did the Sorting thing, and I was sorted into Hufflepuff. But then the Sorting Hat said that something
bad was about to happen. Dumbledore said, "Don't worry, Sorty McGee, I'm 167% sure that nothing bad is about to--" Then Lord Voldemort came into the room with all these
Minecraft spawn eggs. He was like "Yippee-I-Aye, mother Potter," and spawned a bunch of Backrooms entities. I peed my pants, and Voldy used the killing curse on Harry
Potter. Since I was Ron Weasly, I started crying all over my bro Harry. Then Hermiony came and said "This will bring him back to life. Oculas Repairo!" Then Harry's 
glasses exploded. Then Scabbers jumped out of my pocket and ran off. 

I tried to catch him, but whenever I tried, my hands would turn into jelly. He led me to a chest from Fortnite. He squeaked several times as if asking me to open the 
chest. I opened it and there was an enforced AR and a medkit. I took the medkit to the Great Hall, where it was complete chaos! The ceiling was showing alien battles
instead of just the stars. The candles turned into flashbangs that exploded every few minutes. The Battle Bus from Fortnite was flying through the air. All the kids
were using curses on eachother. Dumbledore apeared to be plugging his ears and trying to say something, but nobody could hear him over what I like to call the 
Great Liminal Wizard Battle Royall. It was a total free-for-all and I couldn't find Harry. Hagrid had a sort of market stand where he was saying, "Free hippogriff for
sale! Free hippogrif for sale! Only 24 galions and a knut!" Hermiony was under the Imperiatus Curse and was feeding herself to a hippogriff. All the hippogriffs started
eating eachother, and Draco Malfoy joined their feast. The Battle Bus dropped off a few Fortnite characters. I ended up battling Peely McPeely, who had no gun, so it was
a no-brainer for me. As my dream went on, the Great Hall slowly morphed into a Fortnite map. Then I realized I was dreaming, and that I wasn't Ron Weasly at all.
I was Captain DigDug of the 3Mice! Than I floated into the air, ripped off my Hogwarts uniform, ripped off my orange hair revealing dark brown greasy hair. I put on my
dark purple tophat and screamed, "EVERYONE STOP FIGHTING!" Everyone looked at me and Dumbledore looked releived. I told them who I really was and they tried to kill me
with their guns and wands. But I knew the arts of lucid dreaming! They can't kill me with just puny bullets and magic! But Voldemort said, "Oh, yeah? Avada Kadavera!"

Then I woke up.
