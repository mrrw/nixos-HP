FEVER

Once there was a little girl 
A girl named Penelopy Pesalad Pe-Scrumblington
In 1967
Who one day had a terrible fever.
Her mother took her temperature
And said, "Oh, my! It's so terribly high, that you might die!"

Thuh-Thuh-Thuh

Penelope got a taste of some gross medicine
And almost died cuz it's gross.
Then, she dozed off,
And the story began.

She woke up in the woods
