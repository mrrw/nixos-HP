HOT CHOCOLATE

Once, there was a kind man 
Who lived in a little cottage
In a land of ice and snow.
One day, he was minding his own buisiness,
Drinking hot chocolate,
When suddenly, he heard a knock on the door.
He went to see who was there,
But there was no one.
Only a snow man's head,
Cover'd with blood.
" 'Tis nothing,"
He said.
But behind him, there was his cup,
His cup of hot choco,
Whos contents came alive!
It turned into a monster, 
So large, so monterous,
With a sludgy, brown body
And eyes of marshmallows!!
The man looked behind him,
Butt there was nothing.
Then, there was a trail,
A brown, sludgy trail.
He follow'd it,
As only an idiot would,
He grabbed his gun, and followed the trail
All the way to the bathroom.
Where there was cocoa
Dripping from the faucet.
Then, the ceiling started to drip too!
He tried to run away,
But the door was locked!
The horrible monster was upon him!
He fired again and again,
But all that came out was litle marshmallows!!!

There was missing signs, 
All over the land of ice and snow,
All of the same guy.
The police searched his home,
The only evidence of a murder 
Was a rifle with marshmallows where ammo should be,
And some blood on the walls.
But most importantly, 
A mug of hot chocolate.
